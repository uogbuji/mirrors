	<p>1. <em>Incarnation</em><br />
<br />
Inheart yourself, immensity. Immarrow,<br />
Embone, enrib yourself. The wind won’t borrow<br />
A plane, nor water climb aboard a current,<br />
But you be all we are, and all we aren’t.<br />
You rigged this whirligig, you make it run:<br />
Stop juggling atoms and oppose your thumbs.<br />
That’s what we like, we like our rich to slum.<br />
The rich, it may be, like it too. Enmeat<br />
Yourself so we can rise onto our feet<br />
And meet. For eyes, just take two suns and shrink them.<br />
Make all your thoughts as small as you can think them.<br />
Encrypt in flesh, enigma, what we can’t<br />
Quite English. We will almost understand.<br />
And if there’s things for which we don’t have clearance,<br />
There’s secrecy aplenty in appearance.<br />
Face it, another word for skin is hide.<br />
Show me the face that never lied.</p>
<p><br />
2. <em>Physiology<br /></em><br />
Breathe, bark, beat, pulsar, sleep and wake, sun-eyed sky.<br />
The wonder is. It doesn’t wonder why.<br />
My physiology is sugar burning<br />
To warm saltwater, yours, a tilted turning<br />
That forms the waves. I blink, you night, I brood,<br />
You dusk, I sweat, you dew, for every root<br />
A follicle, for every moon a mood.<br />
Midwinter mornings I have spoken clouds<br />
Aloud. Light was the steam inside your mouth.<br />
Systole blossom, diastole dissolve,<br />
Whether it’s man or sun the sky revolves<br />
Around, the pole will perish and the tether.<br />
Illness in me in you is fevered weather,<br />
My hail and hurricane your fit of coughing.<br />
Both of us winter in a snowbound coffin<br />
And spring up lively, leaves along our boughs.<br />
My wonder holds until I wonder how.</p>
<p><br />
3. <em>Acoustics<br /></em><br />
A hand must pass the strings for them to sound.<br />
The absence of the touch is what resounds.<br />
Axon for axon, we are strung, we are<br />
A kind of neurological guitar<br />
A star has strummed to music. Our musician<br />
Has touched us once, gone quiet now to listen—<br />
Is this mind flat or sharp? How well’s it tuned?<br />
The absence of his hand is opportune,<br />
His famous silence proof we have his ear.<br />
Reverberation needs the aisles clear,<br />
And rumination needs some room to roam.<br />
If he were here, these rhymes would stay at home,<br />
And all that’s hard and hardest-won in us<br />
Be obviated by the obvious.<br />
Have your hosannah, I prefer the hush.<br />
Check the acoustics in this empty hall.<br />
Not the faintest echo when you call.</p>
<p><br />
4. <em>From Darkness into Light<br /></em><br />
The severed parts of darkness grow and glow.<br />
An octopus’s amputations show,<br />
Each tentacle a jiggling gigawatt.<br />
Guillotine one, and watch: Its inky thoughts<br />
Become a giant light bulb, humming, hot.<br />
Anemones mown down sprout back as filaments<br />
Fluorescent to illuminate their element.<br />
It’s painful, sure, transforming into light—<br />
You have to be a little cruel with night<br />
To coax tomorrows out into the sun.<br />
To write at all you have to bite your tongue<br />
Until the phantom pain it feels in silence<br />
Begins to shine. All truth begins in violence,<br />
A purge of dissonants. The heart must wish<br />
To drag a speedboat through the jellyfish—<br />
Electric shreds a mile off the coast<br />
Collected into poems wholly ghost.</p>
<p><br />
5. <em>Thrives Best in Oblique Light<br /></em><br />
Oblique light sheds a shadow slant-rhymed with<br />
Creation. Sun-shy insight thrives in it,<br />
And orchids, and some kinds of fern. It’s best<br />
On lizards: Light them slant, they iridesce.<br />
Oblique light first arose when Fiat lux<br />
Echoed against the darkness. Lux redux.<br />
A glance that goes where it was going to<br />
By glancing off a thing sees in and through<br />
A thing. The beam whose aim is off flies true.<br />
Direct the spotlight just past, matter warms<br />
To our perception, opens up, performs.<br />
Inattention at best intermittent<br />
Is how a word is wrought, or world is written,<br />
Deflected by the hand that shapes its ends<br />
To middles muddled, wayward in their wend.<br />
So now you know why even Homer nods.<br />
I pray for some distraction from my gods.</p>
