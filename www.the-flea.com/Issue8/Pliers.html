	<p>Fist to grip the slippery, twist-easing<br />
the recalcitrant, little mastiff nosing<br />
into crannies of blind manipulations.<br />
The clench we reach for in tight situations.&nbsp;<br />
As once, did Miss Tarbuck, a hard-nosed, roughly<br />
middle-aged science teacher who took us briefly.</p>
<p>It was the period before lunch; <em>muscle forms<br />
in earthworms</em>. Earthworms led to tapeworms,<br />
and one of Miss T’s field trips, bottling species<br />
in a jungle hut, (Dahomey or one of the Guineas.)<br />
Times were late colonial when tapeworms could<br />
grow long as garden hoses. She had one, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It grew, and grew snug in her intestinal miles,<br />
shared her meals. <em>Uncompanionably</em>, she smiled.<br />
<em>Prospect of starving. No medicines. But pliers,<br />
I had pliers. Also meat, a pair of mirrors,<br />
and I like to think, my nerves. For a week I fasted<br />
let the meat grow&nbsp; foul, O very foul indeed,</em></p>
<p><em>then, on a day, arranged my mirrors, the view&nbsp;<br />
not, ahem! flattering,</em> (a snigger or two<br />
though most of us were too agog)&nbsp;<em>I squatted,<br />
cheeks distended, pliers in hand, waited<br />
O, not long, for whatever might&nbsp; come out.<br />
Sure enough. A head! No, more a puckered snout!</em></p>
<p><em>Unpretty! I chose my moment. Then...&nbsp; Snap! I bagged it<br /></em>(unsqueamish Fellows jumped in their seats) <em>I&nbsp; tugged it.<br />
Quite a tussle.</em>&nbsp;(Blokes who played in the scrum<br />
were turning green as they imaged this grim<br />
alimentary pull-through. Tarbuck, unphased,<br />
stuck with the facts, if anything surprised</p>
<p>by our pallor) <em>Useful gadgets, pliers. Of course<br />
I bottled&nbsp; it. Ha ha, no&nbsp; not the pliers, Macinnes,<br />
...and here...</em> (rummaging under her trestle)<br />
...<em>it is</em>.&nbsp; She flourished briefly a large vessel<br />
above her head, placed it with a bang.<br />
<em>Inspect it as you leave</em>.&nbsp; Then the school bell rang</p>
<p>for a lunch now suddenly more complex. We filed<br />
past the pale, well-nourished horror, coiled<br />
in its urinous solution, this worm, flattened<br />
like white pantyhose loosely filled with sand;<br />
it crammed the entire jar. And in the pocket<br />
of her white coat we noted the pliers. Useful gadget,</p>
<p>we agreed, an opposable thumb with uncommon nip<br />
for the use of anyone not wishing to lose their grip.</p>
