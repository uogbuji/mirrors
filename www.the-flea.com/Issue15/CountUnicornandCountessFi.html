				 <em>I meet the Vicomtesse de Milhau, German widow of a Frenchman.&nbsp; I give French lessons to her daughter for 100 francs a month from 9 to 11 in the morning. The Vicomtesse decides to leave Paris for Germany.&nbsp; She buys an auto and plans to drive to Germany in it.&nbsp; She asks me if I’d like to accompany her at 200 francs a month.&nbsp; I accept and we leave August 22, 1901.</em>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Guillame Apollinaire, Letter to James Onimus—1902)

	<p><strong>1. Cyst</strong></p>
<p>Allegedly enriched by trading slaves,<br />
this skilled practitioner of low finance<br />
shot himself into a sudden grave<br />
while at his manor on the coast of France.<br />
<em>“There is no record of the circumstance.”</em></p>
<p>Eclipsed by his own wife’s extravagance<br />
no trace remains of him whom no one mourned—.<br />
Except a cyst of massive prominence<br />
with which the Vicomte’s forehead was adorned:<br />
crude locals still recall <em>‘Count Unicorn’</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2<em>. De Dion-Bouton</em></strong></p>
<p>Gripping that steering pole, keen to maintain her mechanical stride,<br />
dashing through villages, lurching through open countryside,<br />
hissing and rattling, blasting through town in a deafening gale:<br />
gloveless, yet bonneted, fitted emphatically with a dark veil,<br />
sounding the klaxon, scalding the air in her coach leaking steam,<br />
striking the peasantry just like a witch from a bothersome dream—.</p>
<p>Sometimes the auto, silenced and dusty, traveled more slowly,<br />
harnessed to mules, pulled by the worn leathern straps of the lowly,<br />
hailed by the villagers, fallen at last from her ill-mannered grace,<br />
veil at last lifted, eyes flashing angrily, red in the face,<br />
jeered by small children: she who’d once slapped the town pharmacist’s boy<br />
for touching her carriage—<em>Verboten!</em>—a spoiled child defending her toy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Eczema</strong></p>
<p>The pharmacist’s son, the one who’d been slapped<br />
as an innocent curious child,<br />
turned caustic with age and gave vent to his rage<br />
in a memoir he later compiled.</p>
<p>The Countess was <em>“nasty”,</em> <em>“eccentric”,</em> and <em>“smallish”.<br /></em>He’d sketched her in ink mixed with bile—<br />
from red hair to sharp nose to dark eyes cold as crows,<br />
her whole countenance roundly reviled;</p>
<p>from the charm bracelets jangling with jewels and with coins<br />
that clattered on each boney wrist,<br />
to that far stranger greed for attention, that need<br />
to compete with her dead husband’s cyst.</p>
<p>For in summer she shocked town and country alike<br />
by displaying her arms and legs bare<br />
in their scurf-like condition, without inhibition,<br />
as if daring the neighbors to stare.</p>
<p>But whether they raised or averted their eyes,<br />
those same rustics who’d once dared to christen<br />
her husband’s huge horn, with a parallel scorn,<br />
baptized her: <em>‘Die Komtesse Fish Skin’</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Doll’s House</strong></p>
<p>The house has far too many rooms,<br />
yet gives an inescapable impression<br />
of littleness and cramp, of a shelter that entombs—<br />
so mean are the proportions and so cluttered their expression.</p>
<p>A fevered fairytale romance<br />
so over-confidently misconceived,<br />
this old half-timbered ginger-breaded manse,<br />
part Rackham and part Disney, must be seen to be believed.</p>
<p>A gnome-and-elf style Camelot—<br />
its belfries, spires, and balconies extend<br />
around a courtyard that’s become a parking lot<br />
for couples who drive out into the countryside to spend</p>
<p>numbed Sundays drinking steins of beer<br />
in what was once a witch’s dining hall;<br />
or waltzing at a stilted tea dance in her queer<br />
old airborne parlor—buttressed from below—yet poised to fall</p>
<p>from rough-hewn white-washed posts<br />
festooned with masks and gargoyles far too coy<br />
to frighten, with their feeble jeers and idle boasts,<br />
the Hansel or the Gretel lost in the pharmacist’s grown boy.</p>
<p>And all this was the work of one<br />
dimwitted local jack-of-every-trade:<br />
an architect and painter and less-than-master mason,<br />
exclusively contracted and then grossly underpaid.</p>
<p>Each fall she left instructions for<br />
the work he was to undertake that spring.<br />
Each summer she charged home—refortified for war!—<br />
with calls for drastic change that led to months of quarreling.</p>
<p>One year she sent the luckless man<br />
crawling down the roof’s ledge with a saw<br />
to guillotine a turret, just-built with his bare hands—<br />
its failure to adapt to her foul mood its only flaw.</p>
<p>How concrete then is psychic truth—<br />
boy’s memoir, witch’s castle, each self-styled.<br />
Like his, hers tells Grimm tales of a resentful youth:<br />
she must have had her doll’s house snatched away when still a child.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>5. <em>“Starry-Headed Poet”</em></strong></p>
<p>In Deutschland but two months, he visited<br />
his namesake’s miracle-producing head.</p>
<p>Transported to Cologne, in fabled times,<br />
the ship on which it traveled had stopped mid-Rhine,</p>
<p>held fast by some mysterious force—which willed<br />
that the relic grace a chapel there, just built</p>
<p>for fateful reasons not till then divined.<br />
The saint’s head stayed. The church was redefined.</p>
<p>Thus far the legend, made far more exact<br />
in 1852 by cold clear fact—</p>
<p>by a mineral spring discovered near the road<br />
down which the ailing flock had dragged their loads</p>
<p>for centuries.&nbsp; Henceforth the sacred shrine<br />
has all but turned this water into wine</p>
<p>and lends its name, <em>Apollinaris</em>, to<br />
a factory-bottled saintly residue</p>
<p>disseminated worldwide ever since.<br />
Oh miracle! Oh severed head’s footprints!</p>
<p><br />
<em>(after Francis Steegmuller’s biography—Apollinaire, Poet Among The Painters)<br />
