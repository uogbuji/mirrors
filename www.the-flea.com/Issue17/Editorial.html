	<p><font size="5">Your</font> Hble &amp; Obdt <em>Editor</em>, still somewhat be-fuddl’d from his Flea-some <em>Birthday</em> Celebrations, after much late Hurley-Burley, wassailling, &amp; carowsing with Messrs. Marlowe, Donne, Gould, Hope, Jonson, Edgar, Murray, Page, &amp;c., &amp;c., with drinking of numberless <em>Toasts</em>, to naughtie-ey’d Mistress <em>Annie Drysdale</em>, Highe-spirited Mistress <em>Patricia Jones</em>,&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;merrily-laughing Mistress <em>Anna Evans, inter alia</em>; &amp;&nbsp;moreover, despite a lay-Monethe’s recuperatiue <em>Respite</em>, which hath, nevertheless, &amp; notwithstanding (nor neither notwithsitting), left him not altogether in full Restoration of his erst-while Powers &amp; faculties; he now bringeth to publick Lighte this XVIIth Broadside of <font color="#FF0000"><em>The FLEA</em></font><font color="#000000">;</font>&nbsp;whiche present being, in point of Fact, the <em>June</em> Issueance, (but <em>July</em> now seruing as the new <em>June</em>, such is your Editor’s dilatory Belatednesse, as he trusts ye may well apprehend); &amp;, it may be, hauing let this uerie same Sentence, which you now read, &amp; which he now penneth, his flailing, quivering Quill dashing off Pixel vpon supernumerary Pixel, — this Sentence, (say I), he letteth run on somewhat rather over-lengthily, until the uery Thread &amp; Pith of its Gist be lost beyond recall, in Clauses &amp; Phrazes Pell-Mell, which evaporate fast-fadeing from the Minde’s-eye, from the Brain’s Cognizance,&nbsp;&amp; away beyond all syntactical Devizement: — thus he cedeth the Editorial insteade, into the more secure Hande, and fine-focus’d Attention, of a <strong><em>Geste-Editor</em></strong>, Mr. <em>Pulex Illustrissimus</em>; as ye shall find heretounder appended, <em>viz.,</em> thus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="4"><em>Geste Editorial</em>,</font><br />
in which Pulex (<em>alter</em>, Anon), a Descendant<br />
of John Donne’s<br />
Original <em><font color="#FF0000">Flea</font></em> Addresseth,<br />
Over Twenty Years later,<br />
His Host</strong></p>
<p><font size="4">What</font>, sir, are we in the waie to Paules Crosse, to heere the Deane preach of the paines of hell? Hee maketh moe men to lie awake, to seeke out&nbsp;&amp; sigh for their sinnes; thanne I &amp; all my race of rest-robbers and night-annoyes, to seeke &amp; scratch by candlelight. Hee is a grete disturber of the peace of this citie of London. And yet I love him well (for I &amp; my people have ever loved sanctity, and habited with holy men); as my ancestor loved him (that dyed in his service &amp; liveth in his verse).<br />
<br />
This famous <em>FLEA</em>, sir, was Jack Donnes faytheful freende &amp; fellow, XX yeeres agoe. They sorted well together; being both lads of metile &amp; foes to quietnesse, good bedde-man &amp; haunters of hostelries; &amp; as the one was nimble of his limbes, so the other of his wittes, and bothe prodigious leapers in their owne kind, soe that a man might not know where to have them next.<br />
<br />
Jacke Donne (that is nowe the Dean) would have had his faithfull <em>FLEA</em> doe the office of a bedde for him &amp; his mistresse (since shee would meete with him in no other). If you would know how this Illustrious <em>FLEA</em> (pulex illustrissimus) dyed, hauing performed a service of soe great weighte; reade Jack Donne's lines.<br />
<br />
Fare you well, sir. In so greate a press as crowdeth aboute the Crosse you are like to lose me (and find a dozen moe). If I may come to him through the throng of sermon swallowers, I will seek entertainment with the Dean; &amp; as my ancestor labour'd to serve his youth in the gratification (though slight) soe will I his age in the mortification of the flesh.</p>
