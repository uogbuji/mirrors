	<p>1</p>
<p>The sunrise is not grand and not pristine.<br />
That is a disappointment. After years<br />
of <em>Dawn spread out her fingertips of rose</em><br />
I am appalled at what instead appears:<br />
a garish scarlet sun, the sky — unclean<br />
with fumes from scooters, cars and buses — glows,<br />
sending its angry light over the scene</p>
<p>around me — flat-roofed houses crowded on<br />
the hills. The shadows stubbornly recede<br />
as waves of red light wake a feral dog,<br />
skinny and maimed, who ambles off to feed<br />
on garbage or on handouts and the dawn<br />
spreads whiter light now, burning off the fog<br />
hanging in low spots, cool night-breezes gone.</p>
<p>And Athens comes to life: commuters throng<br />
to jobs, cafes fill up, the buses roar,<br />
the ferries load, and troupes of tourists don<br />
sun-hats and backpacks, moving in groups for<br />
the sights they’ve dreamed of seeing now so long,<br />
and this day is that longing’s denouement.<br />
It’s early and they smile. Their step is strong.</p>
<p>A group of us lounges under some trees<br />
in a park, our backpacks thrown down at our feet<br />
and plan the day. A throng of young Greek kids<br />
with basketballs think it will be a treat<br />
to sneer at tourists and so start to tease<br />
us, smirking. But we’re like caryatids,<br />
bearing the weight of impudence with ease,</p>
<p>unmoved, unbending, not embarrassed when<br />
they shout, <em>Where’s the Acropolis?</em> We laugh,<br />
throw up our hands and say, <em>Hell, I don’t know!</em><br />
<em>Where is it? You got me!</em> This is a gaffe<br />
for us, the tourists. Our tormenters grin<br />
uneasily. Our answer is a blow<br />
that spoils their morning fun. Then we begin</p>
<p>a pick-up game with them. We dunk, we leap,<br />
dribble behind our backs, put on a show,<br />
and win their admiration. We shake hands<br />
and head on to the subway. We will go<br />
to the Agora — then the upward sweep<br />
to the Acropolis, which still commands<br />
this city from its high and rocky steep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>When artists depict ancient Greece, they paint<br />
white temples, statues, white outcroppings, robes<br />
of white and, far away, the Parthenon,<br />
marble on marble where paleness explodes<br />
up on the alabaster hill — no taint<br />
of dark or shadow, all colour foregone,<br />
pure as the unstained garment of some saint.</p>
<p>The white suggests a translucence of thought —<br />
the radiance of the philosophy<br />
that Athens fostered — Socrates and all<br />
who came after him — white, the purity<br />
of minds unclouded, unstained minds that sought<br />
the truth — deep, soulful minds that heard the call<br />
of wisdom and the music reason taught.</p>
<p>But had we walked up to that height in days<br />
when Aristotle, Aristophanes<br />
or Xeno strolled there, it would not be as<br />
artists envisioned it. The summer breeze<br />
would carry smells of burning fat, and sprays<br />
of sacrificial blood spurt as the adze<br />
cleaved skulls of cows. Blood-handed priests would raise</p>
<p>livers and kidneys high, and they would sing<br />
praise to Athena, Wise Virgin. The reek<br />
of entrails and the cries of dying beasts,<br />
the glossolalia priestesses spewed, would speak<br />
a different story, say a different thing<br />
from what we have been told. We’d see the priests<br />
smelling of smoke and death and offering,</p>
<p>and they would not be white. The acolytes,<br />
young anorexic girls who had been given<br />
as children to Athena, doomed to serve<br />
the virgin daughter of Zeus up in heaven,<br />
would run, wild-eyed, from place to place, their sights<br />
not set on marriage, but set to preserve<br />
denial, lodged here in these sacred heights;</p>
<p>and in those times the statues would not be<br />
pale alabaster, but be painted — all<br />
the images coated with garish hues,<br />
as gaudy as the icons one finds on the wall<br />
of some Baroque church or a deity<br />
carved on a Hindu temple — and the Muse<br />
possessed the poet and hovered fearfully.</p>
<p>The picture of a white, ethereal place<br />
is false. The years have bleached the paint away,<br />
millennia of rain washed off the rocks<br />
and sent the topsoil out into the bay<br />
of Piraeus. The sun has lent its grace<br />
to whiten stones so that they look like flocks.<br />
The stench of sacrifice has been erased.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>And yet we stand at the Erechtheion<br />
and marvel. Though it once was a snake-pit,<br />
we see the Porch of Maidens and we feel<br />
the eloquence, the simple grace that it<br />
communicates — a grace that has passed on<br />
from modern life-and here is the appeal<br />
of this ruined complex from a world long gone—</p>
<p>the pull of places one student described<br />
as "piles of rock." The sacrificial smoke,<br />
the wild-eye chanting priestesses who were<br />
deprived of sex and marriage, the bloodstroke<br />
of sacrificing priests who would imbibe<br />
red wine mingled with opium and myrrh<br />
and speak in tongues; the industry that thrived</p>
<p>on fortune-telling, and on prophecy;<br />
the animals who died in droves, the smell<br />
of offerings burnt endlessly to soothe<br />
the never-dying gods — these things may tell<br />
a version different from the history<br />
we know — but sculptures, stark and pure and smooth,<br />
do hint at some hidden profundity.</p>
<p>A light broke through the practices that ruled<br />
that world, and the beliefs that held the soul<br />
of ancient man and woman. Though he walked<br />
past fatuous altars, Aristotle<br />
was perspicacious, and his heart had cooled<br />
to what he saw around him. So he talked<br />
about the mind, and his perspective fueled</p>
<p>the explorations that would lead to when<br />
the yoke of false perception was thrown off,<br />
and reason grew to be the one fixed star<br />
society looks to. If I must scoff,<br />
I'll scoff at what I felt today: chagrin<br />
that Athens as I first saw it fell far<br />
short of expectations I had indulged in.</p>
<p>The cars, the air pollution, the presence<br />
of Dairy Queen and Starbucks should not dim<br />
what happened here; back in the ancient days,<br />
psychotic worship, the practice of&nbsp; grim,<br />
destructive rites, could choke off reason’s sense,<br />
but nonetheless&nbsp; light penetrated haze<br />
that curled from altar-smoke and from&nbsp; incense;</p>
<p>just so, Athens may look quotidian,<br />
not magic in the its modern-day routine,<br />
like any other city in I might see<br />
in Europe — yet a vision, too, was seen,<br />
right here that led the human race to shun<br />
old superstitions. Inevitably,<br />
it triumphed, and the old world was undone.</p>
<br />
