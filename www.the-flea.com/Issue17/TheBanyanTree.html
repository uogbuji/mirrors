	<p>1.</p>
<p>This afternoon while driving here I spied on the horizon<br />
a green enormous dome that rested calmly in the distance.<br />
It crested over the landscape, like a silent fountain rising.<br />
Serenely dominant mirage—it met with no resistance.<br />
The afternoon was hot and still, yet by the speed of travel<br />
a breeze was manufactured which blew through the open window<br />
distracting hair and sleeves—it stirred all things, all things unraveled,<br />
all things except that green mirage, so far away no wind could blow,<br />
no breeze disturb, its ghostly calm, its constancy beyond all flow.</p>
<p>The driver of the car, his eyes on my eyes, spoke at last.<br />
He told me “<em>It’s a banyan tree</em>”. I nodded. And he smiled.<br />
In perfect understanding, several silent minutes passed—<br />
our shared gaze by this solitary crown of green beguiled.<br />
And then my eyes returned from heights to depths, from sky to earth;<br />
and as a counterweight to what’s remote, what looms and spreads,<br />
I saw, condensed and closer by, small figures bodied forth—<br />
on either side of that small dusty winding road down which we sped<br />
small naked and half-naked bathers filled the gutters at road’s edge.</p>
<p>They hugged the ground, they splashed about in murky muddied waters<br />
and, as we passed, crouched modestly, concealing loins and breasts:<br />
the whole nude family of man, poor parents, sons, and daughters—<br />
exposed, yet sheltered still within the safety of their nest.<br />
Averted faces, glistening limbs, all blurred as we sped past.<br />
The trunks of roadside palms would hide them momentarily.<br />
The youngest stood and stared, while others turned, their eyes downcast.<br />
But all were busy blossoming within the realm that lay beneath<br />
the canopy—the mighty and yet not Almighty banyan tree.</p>
<p>The bathers, they were miles away—yet that tree’s spreading branches<br />
seemed somehow to contain them, to conjoin them each to each<br />
as well as to itself. It put a limit to expanses<br />
of sky too vast to comprehend, too far beyond to reach.<br />
And rather than soar off in spirit’s burning blue and gold<br />
and bodiless rise up beyond earth’s dust and mud and clay,<br />
the anchored banyan rose but to the top of the bound soul—.<br />
And to that sheltered soul, to its abysmal depths, it seemed to say:<br />
<em>Rest here a while, beneath my branches, rest here in my shade, and bathe</em>—.</p>
<p>Thus to that bound soul banyan lent of what was infinite a single touch<br />
and gave to what is not enough a yearning fragment of what’s far too much.</p>
<p><br />
2.</p>
<p>The restaurant was open to the street—its walls of thatch<br />
and shutters of bamboo removed each morn, each night replaced.<br />
It was, at eight a.m., the perfect place to sit and catch<br />
that pulse of street-life windows tend to muffle or erase.<br />
Ruled by a casual chaos almost musical in form,<br />
a cadence crude yet intricate—controlled, and yet insane—<br />
mechanical, yet human in the eye of its own storm,<br />
the street here blooms and bustles with a force that cannot be contained,<br />
a traffic of percussion, sudden harmony, and brief refrain.</p>
<p>Exhausted, I confess, by constant business down below,<br />
between hot sips of coffee my eyes wandered up the sky.<br />
They followed the slim path of one long slender bamboo pole—<br />
possessed by the desire to ascend, to simplify.<br />
The pole rose—graceful, quiet. My gaze lifted—freed, set loose.<br />
When suddenly, though weightless still, my eyes began to sink—<br />
for from the tip of that long pole, as from a hangman’s noose,<br />
was dangling over rooftops, all alone, suspended on the brink<br />
of emptiness, of endless space—a tiny birdcage painted pink!</p>
<p>A screech of brakes drew my attention back down to the street,<br />
where, from a rusty pick-up truck I saw jump to the curb<br />
two men, a woman, and a girl. They landed on their feet<br />
and set to work at once, efficiently, without a word.<br />
Huge handfuls of bright gray and purple prawns, fresh from the sea,<br />
were scooped up by the men into a shallow dented pan.<br />
The woman raised the pan, and bending slightly at the knees<br />
she hoisted it up on her head—and straightening her spine, she then<br />
reached out like one half-blind and grabbed a hold of her young daughter’s hand.</p>
<p>They stood there and they waited, cautiously, to cross the street,<br />
both staring at the steady stream of traffic rushing by.<br />
And as I sat and watched them, at the same time I could see<br />
suspended high above them that pink birdcage in the sky.<br />
I was too far away to hear if that caged bird was singing.<br />
The mother and her daughter were too occupied to care—.<br />
And yet it seemed this task, this earth, to which they both were clinging<br />
was sheltered somehow by this silent sense of song that filled the air<br />
with a benign indifference almost too powerful to bear.</p>
<p>Then all the noise and movement of the street before me seemed a sort of dance,<br />
this melody inaudible maintaining order in this realm of chance.</p>
<p><br />
3.</p>
<p>These strange sensations of a shelter offered from a distance—<br />
these strange embraces haunt me and possess me, standing guard<br />
like solemn sentries at the very borders of existence—<br />
set over me like midnight’s calm configured crown of stars.<br />
Are they then only shadows, these conjunctions? Harmonies<br />
the soul must conjure daily from dust’s decomposed detail?<br />
Or are they patterns, simple structures, true geometries,<br />
organic laws of balance, sentient scriptures that shall never fail<br />
to soothe the troubled heart of any creature chasing its own tail.</p>
<p>A vibrant trill of birdsong? An experience of god?<br />
This morning, just past dawn, as I flung open my porch doors,<br />
instinctively I raised my eyes to heaven’s bright facade<br />
to trace that song through sky and treetops to its hidden source.<br />
I found the tiny boisterous bird, perched on a neighbor’s roof,<br />
perched at the peak, upon a broken terra-cotta crown.<br />
Upon this weathered ornament—it sat and sang, aloof.<br />
And yet its song would not have haunted so, had not another sound<br />
arisen like the steam of dew evaporating from the ground:</p>
<p>a gentle yet abrasive scrape on an uneven surface,<br />
it spread in all directions far below that bird enthroned;<br />
a song less idle, more mundane, wed firmly to its purpose—<br />
the gardener’s broom upon the garden’s paths of smooth swept stone.<br />
I locked my door and went, in search of breakfast, down the street.<br />
In front of every shop and home were men and women sweeping.<br />
All eyes were on the ground. My own were focused on my feet.<br />
Why do men bow their heads? To count their heavy steps? To hide their weeping?<br />
Or is it the result of some celestial secret that they’re keeping?</p>
<p>That secret grew material moments later when I sensed<br />
upon the back of my bowed head a soft persistent touch—<br />
a branch of heavy blossoms overgrowing its stone fence<br />
dipped down as I passed by. My skin was oh so slightly brushed.<br />
Ten minutes later, in a cool cafe, still staring down,<br />
I stir my hot espresso—drop the spoon—and almost swoon—!<br />
Above my head a ceiling fan whirls round without a sound<br />
and, as the surface of the sea on calm nights will reflect the moon,<br />
that fan’s reflected in the handle of that tiny silver spoon.</p>
<p>And just this touch of vertigo is thus enough to make me understand<br />
the marriage of all heaven to all earth is no more and no less than man.</p>
