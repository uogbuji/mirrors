	<p>‘This house’, she says, ‘secretes its memories<br />
behind the grime; behind the fingerprints<br />
that mark its walls. Its ghosts though, are not his.’<br />
She doesn’t say his name out loud: the hint</p>
<p>of conversation in the room next door<br />
suppresses any more that might be said;<br />
might serve to point out guilt and shame, which war<br />
had forced to ground and shelter in her head.</p>
<p>The kitchen window is an open wound<br />
the world has still not healed. Each day<br />
she looks on through into its heart; its ruined<br />
vessels, once so full of life, their way</p>
<p>obstructed, grey with constant death in life.<br />
‘His hands were small.’ Her sudden words cut through<br />
the waiting air, they pare it like a knife;<br />
prepare the day for ancient pain’s <em>wu’du</em>.</p>
<p>The ‘asr adhan calls her small surrender,<br />
its amplifier buzzing like the flies;<br />
she might have said his hands were ‘small… and slender’,<br />
but ‘might have been’ was swallowed by the cries.</p>
<p>The kitchen wall has been rebuilt with mud,<br />
though straw’s in short supply—it’s fed to cows.<br />
Once, she might have joked ‘they have enough of blood!’<br />
She rubs the soap block down her faded blouse.</p>
<p>Death came here in <em>Al Naqba</em>—forty-eight;<br />
no houses then in Rafah, only sand,<br />
barasti huts, cholera and fate.<br />
‘The final time he ever held my hand.’</p>
<p>What year that was, she doesn’t say out loud;<br />
an aeon-spanning second she relives<br />
but never mentions, ever—she’s too proud;<br />
it never gives her peace. It never gives.</p>
<p>The moment when his grip went slack and failed.<br />
The moment when the bullet raised his head.<br />
The moment when time stopped, the adhan wailed.<br />
The moment when his <em>jellabia</em> bled.</p>
<p>She’s hanging out her <em>sheyla</em> on the line.<br />
Two sons, a husband, three nephews and a niece<br />
—and him. She stitched each shroud; each Palestine;<br />
each laid in war to rest in hope of peace.</p>
<p>She talks of them, each one, but not of him;<br />
for though they say she’s nearly seventy-two<br />
when she conjures him, she’s sullen, grim:<br />
the brother that she never really knew.</p>
