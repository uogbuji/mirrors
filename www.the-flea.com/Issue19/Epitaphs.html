	<p><strong>R.I.P. JOHN SKELTON<br /></strong><em>c. 1460 – 21 June 1529</em>
</p>
<p>Here lies John Skelton<br />
Worn to a skeleton<br />
By tumbling in verse,<br />
For he loved to curse<br />
Or, even worse,<br />
Fulminate, excoriate,<br />
And dub himself ‘Laureate’.<br />
<strong><br />
~~~<br />
<br />
R.I.P. SIR THOMAS WYATT</strong><br />
<em>1503-October 11, 1542</em></p>
<p>He fell in love with Anne Boleyn<br />
Yet somehow saved his precious skin<br />
And introduced the English sonnet<br />
Which Shakespeare stole from Thomas Wyatt.<br />
<strong><br />
~~~<br />
<br />
R.I.P. HENRY HOWARD<br /></strong><em>1517-January 19, 1547</em></p>
<p>He and his friend Sir Thomas Wyatt<br />
Were fathers of the English sonnet<br />
Which did no good, for the puppet jury<br />
Condemned to death the Earl of Surrey.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. GEORGE PUTTENHAM</strong><br />
<em>C. 1529-1590</em></p>
<p>His <em>Arte of English Poesy<br /></em>
Made him a scholar known to be<br />
A womanizing, rutting ram,<br />
Our ancient Cousin Puttenham.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. SIR WALTER RALEIGH</strong><br />
<em>January 22, 1552(?) – Oct 29, 1618</em>
</p>
<p>A seeker after wealth and power,<br />
He spent some time in London’s Tower<br />
After he unwisely wed —<br />
And then Sir Walter lost his head.<br />
<br />
~~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. EDMUND SPENSER</strong><br />
<em>c. 1552-January 13, 1599</em></p>
<p>His vast romance, <em>The Faerie Queene,</em><br />
Cannot be read but may be seen<br />
To need the work of a condenser —<br />
Too late, we fear, for Edmund Spenser.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. SIR PHILIP SIDNEY</strong><br />
<em>November 30, 1554 - October 17, 1586</em></p>
<p>Philip Sidney<br />
Loved his kidney<br />
Pie and sonnets<br />
On shepherdesses<br />
With their tresses<br />
Clad in bonnets.</p>
<p>It’s bad enough to have to worry<br />
About Phil Sidney and Howard Surrey,¹<br />
But I'll be damned, I will be bound,<br />
If I'll lose sleep over Tom² and Pound.³<br />
_____<br />
¹Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, 1517-19 January 1547;&nbsp;² T. S. Eliot, September 26, 1888-January 4, 1965; ³Ezra Pound, October 30, 1885-November 1, 1972.</p>
<p><strong>~~~<br />
<br />
R.I.P. CHRISTOPHER MARLOWE<br /></strong><em>February 6, 1564 - May 30, 1593</em></p>
<p>Kit Marlow had a golden tongue<br />
Which was cut short when he was stabbed<br />
In his right eye, not in the lung.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P.&nbsp; WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</strong><br />
<em>23 April 1564-April 23, 1616</em></p>
<p>Word-warrior: when he was spent<br />
He went into retirement.<br />
Although he tried to disappear,<br />
We still hear William shake a spear.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. THOMAS CAMPION</strong><br />
<em>February 12, 1567 - March 1, 1620</em></p>
<p>Thomas Campion loved the lute<br />
But not the trumpet ... not a toot,<br />
Nor did he care a bit for rhyme<br />
Though he wrote lute songs all the time.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. BEN JONSON</strong><br />
<em>June 11, 1572 - August 6, 1637</em></p>
<p>Although convicted of manslaughter,<br />
He preferred to evoke man’s laughter<br />
In poems using rime, not con-<br />
sonance, O rare Ben Jonson!<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. JOHN DONNE</strong><br />
<em>June 19, 1572-March 31, 1631</em></p>
<p>He took a playwright’s child as bride<br />
And wrote defending suicide,<br />
Used Anne, his wife’s name, as a pun<br />
To indicate he was un-Donne,<br />
But he lived longer than did she,<br />
And lingers still in poesy.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. MARY WROTH<br /></strong><em>1587-1653</em></p>
<p>Raleigh, Sidney, Pembroke were her blood;<br />
The Fates therefore took her at their flood<br />
To be a distaff poet cut from cloth<br />
Of gold which made the Muses’ Mary Wroth.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. ROBERT HERRICK</strong><br />
<em>August 24, 1591-October 15, 1674</em></p>
<p>At first a member of the Sons of Ben,<br />
He threw his sermon at a snorer when<br />
Put out to pasture as a country cleric.<br />
The gentry loved their vicar Robert Herrick.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. GEORGE HERBERT</strong><br />
<em>April 3, 1593-March 1, 1633</em></p>
<p>As good a Christian as he was a man,<br />
Of course it was a part of his Lord’s plan<br />
To take the sacred verse that George had sung<br />
With all his heart and wring it from his lung.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. THOMAS CAREW</strong><br />
<em>February 1595-March 22, 1640</em></p>
<p>When he saw that St. Albans was in bed<br />
Beside the queen, he dropped the candle, said,<br />
‘So sorry!’ to the king who spotted nary<br />
A thing that eve. The queen waxed good to Carew.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. EDMUND WALLER</strong><br />
<em>March 3, 1606-October 21, 1687</em></p>
<p>He managed to survive by selling out<br />
His co-conspirators. Never devout,<br />
A shifty man whom some would call a crawler<br />
Was the sly survivor Edmund Waller.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. JOHN MILTON</strong><br />
<em>December 9, 1608-November 8, 1674</em></p>
<p>The first things that he lost were both his eyes,<br />
The second were the keys to Paradise,<br />
Which finally were found. Others built on<br />
This poor foundation the Parodies of Milton.<br />
<br />
~~~<br />
<br />
<strong>R.I.P. JOHN SUCKLING</strong><br />
<em>February 10, 1609 - June 1, 1642</em></p>
<p>He took a beating and he lost his pride<br />
To his rival for a disputed bride;<br />
As a rhymer he was a sort of duckling —<br />
Or so it’s rumored of Sir John Suckling.</p>
<p><br />
