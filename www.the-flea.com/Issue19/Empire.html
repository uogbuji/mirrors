	<p>I throw down the paper, dash to make my train,<br />
and find myself in furious squalls of rain<br />
soaking through my jacket and my shirt.<br />
My fellow helots look just slightly better<br />
with cheap umbrellas battered in the gale<br />
that snaps the points and leaves them slightly wetter<br />
than they might have hoped. A final spurt<br />
of energy gets me underground. Not hale<br />
or healthy or quite content, one still must strive<br />
to curse each minute till the train arrives.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And as I thrust my way to get that seat<br />
that isn’t taken yet, all of my neat<br />
stratagems to reach my destination<br />
dissolve in anticipation of the walk<br />
on the other side to get to where I’m going.<br />
Subway signs don’t note precipitation.<br />
<em>For God’s sake, man! It’s only seven blocks!<br /></em>And thus begins a ritual of throwing<br />
furtive hands ceiling-ward. ‘Do mind the gap.’<br />
<em>Christ, I think I need a better map.<br /></em>&nbsp;<br />
—<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And anyway, the headlines always stink.<br />
Someone’s robbed us blind or gone to bed<br />
with hookers, or just landed in the clink.<br />
And if that’s not enough, look at the funnies—<br />
Imperialism rears its ugly head<br />
as General Caesar heads out to the sticks<br />
to battle Aster … Vercingetorix.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Caesar thinks himself an Alexander,<br />
easy on the eye, hung like a horse,<br />
a famous man, Rome’s best damn field commander—<br />
a man-slut, middle-aged, and balding Wop.&nbsp;<br />
(That kind of language just won’t do, of course.<br />
We’ll give the just rejoinder to the Roman:<br />
<em>Wop’s rich coming from an Oklahoman</em>.)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And in the other corner’s … whatshisname,<br />
mustachioed Celt in plaid with magic potions<br />
and loyal, dumbass friends. Eternal fame<br />
depends, so often, on what your people brew<br />
as much as ‘freedom’ and other abstract notions.<br />
We’re at endgame. The Gauls are out of luck.<br />
Caesar’s outside Alesia, and it’s fucked.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Slapstick abounds. How could it otherwise<br />
with trenches, booby-traps, and catapults?<br />
M. Hulot, but everybody dies.<br />
And while we’re rooting for the underdog,<br />
we can all predict the end result:<br />
Oh, God, it’s just horrific … cut to tape!<br />
A raucous teenage sex romp, but with rape.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Our hero (anti-hero?) ends in chains<br />
for Caesar’s Triumph. Everybody’s sad,<br />
since after all, it’s decent to complain<br />
when someone screws up self-determination—<br />
downright rude, and maybe even bad.<br />
Besides, the Gallic villagers seemed nice<br />
(but let’s not mention human sacrifice).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Still, Vercingetorix has got a trick<br />
he hasn’t pulled as Caesar turns around<br />
during a prison interview. The prick,<br />
confident he’s won, does not consider<br />
druidic skill with magic mushrooms, ground<br />
into a potion. Out comes a hidden blotter.<br />
Caesar’s thirsty. SHIT! DON’T DRINK THE WATER!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Here be groovy shapes, man, but poor Gaius<br />
is not a weekend warrior, and he sees<br />
horrific things. Those dodgy trips can try us,<br />
even with experience, and here<br />
we have a guy who’ll just have water, please<br />
and only knows that he’s been truly spiked<br />
when everything changes shape. Here’s what it’s like:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<em>A Roman road opens out from that bare room<br />
through hundreds of miles, and reaching the Subura,<br />
narrows to an alley steeped in the gloom<br />
of sagging insulae, emptied chamber pots,<br />
graffiti of dicks, vaginas, something with a goat,<br />
and what the fuck was that?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It’s Caesar’s ex-flame Servilia with a brush,<br />
a black-haired dame approaching middle age,<br />
buxom and arrogant.<br />
She’s conjugating verbs around his name<br />
in every tense—and every one obscene,<br />
a hideous manifesto.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
He sees a crowd<br />
gathered around his lover armed with sticks<br />
pushing around the togate men who guard<br />
her composition, howling out abuse<br />
in monotonal rapid-fire.<br />
A melee soon ensues&nbsp;<br />
between the Senators and lumpen scum.<br />
Caesar cries out, ‘What have I become?’<br />
his eyes fixed on his rough admirers, and scared.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
How did he come to this, a son of Venus<br />
allied to the cynical pimps and whores<br />
who call out idly from the corridors<br />
of half-decrepit buildings?<br />
But they’re my base! Stop, Caesar! Don’t be an ass.<br />
Remember that you’re of a different class.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A voice calls, ‘Dude!’ and soon, Servilia<br />
grows taller, male, and … turns …<br />
into Vercingetorix,<br />
who almost seems to glow …</em> and Caesar smiles<br />
at the Gaul and guards, and focuses on a map,<br />
finds his position, and goes to take a nap.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
And though he laughs when the colors disappear<br />
and doesn’t have the prankster crucified,<br />
the vision set before his eyes has reared<br />
a dark suspicion, vicious as a hydra,<br />
that ending up on the Senate’s losing side<br />
is not the only peril that he faces.<br />
Beware the mob. <em>What do you call these? Traces?<br /></em>
&nbsp;<br />
‘Tracers.’ Antony supplies the word.<br />
<em>I guess he’d know</em>, thinks Caesar with a smile.<br />
Besides, the whole damn notion is absurd.<br />
Give ’em bread and circuses, and bouts<br />
of gladiatorial combat for a while,<br />
&nbsp;and citizens will live with monarchy<br />
and like it. So much for democracy.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
—<br />
&nbsp;<br />
That jerk Tiresias is now asleep<br />
and snores so loudly that it wakes the neighbors<br />
who shout out curses. ‘Keep it down, you creep,<br />
or medicate! Do yourself a favor!’<br />
The prophet, though, is out of it and dreaming,<br />
oblivious to us, and to our scheming.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is not a country for old men,<br />
and thus old men will play by different rules,<br />
babbling about what happened way back when<br />
while tinkering with antiquated tools…<br />
unless they sleep, their wisdom overgrown<br />
with tendrils of fatigue. We’re on our own.</p>
