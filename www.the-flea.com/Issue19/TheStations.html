	<p>1. The sunken day inherits me.</p>
<p>A levied head is perched atop a spear.<br />
I knew of it: its voice struck even tones;<br />
an oath occluded its eyes. The surroundings<br />
denied its features; stripped the prickly burr.</p>
<p>Of what was he made?: abstraction and myth.<br />
The heart is metaphor for now: it could be sand and ash.</p>
<p>I learned the arbiter is man<br />
and when the verdict stilled my blood,<br />
a limp relief distilled my joints. The caustic thread<br />
was clipped, the one that stitched me to heaven’s hand.</p>
<p><br />
2. The splintering shock of delivery.</p>
<p>A discourse gathered on the horizon.<br />
The censors split my lips.<br />
This sentence will have but one<br />
meaning if nothing follows it. Trust me.</p>
<p>I never had a thought outside myself:<br />
shadows circled the ground like bits<br />
of carrion dripping from the sky;<br />
an oculus of logic picking apart the backbone of another life.</p>
<p>A scene from the end-dream:<br />
the sky unfurled like rumpled cloth:<br />
blazing angels strapped to my chest:<br />
a breathless descent while bodies crumble to ash.</p>
<p>In dreams, some will find an umbra of ash<br />
blocking their sight, a gray chimaera in their brain.<br />
But for now, the path is lined with skulls,<br />
friend, and only one way off of it.</p>
<p><br />
3. A vision blurred with mortality.</p>
<p>Red apples fell beside the chattering birds<br />
and woke the shrunken earth. It grumbled for days.<br />
The heavens penetrated a fissure, stabbed<br />
the scraping rocks, discharged a fricative.<br />
(All language is a failed attempt at truth.)</p>
<p>I sabotaged myself: tendered my mass<br />
for diaphanous schemes and became<br />
a supplicant for one: an ink-stained thumb.</p>
<p>My will rotted too: a clingy charlatan<br />
locked in an empty, mirrored room:<br />
receding like the tail-devouring snake<br />
in a glacial pattern of concentric rings<br />
until what’s left is nothing but a sense.</p>
<p>This body was an ill-conceived device,<br />
a sentinel and nothing more, an end<br />
of knotted rope suspended from the clouds.</p>
<p>(I feel the math of ages trickling down<br />
my spine, a binary stream sweetly engorged.)</p>
<p>So how do I proceed with the grit of man<br />
lodged in the recesses of my mouth:<br />
a quarantined breath:<br />
retreating toward the only vanishing point?</p>
<p><br />
4. An intractable tether to the past.</p>
<p>A squall erupted about the periphery;<br />
the center shifts. The same old bird<br />
descends again but wears a different mask.<br />
I’ve yet to speak to you my little dove—<br />
<em>coo, coo</em>—tomorrow is a dissonant shriek.</p>
<p>Each path betrays its lineage. The earth<br />
exacts a studied force.<br />
I walked to where I was meant to walk, and now?<br />
The cages ring with enharmonic sighs.</p>
<p>In shallow pools silverfish released<br />
and gathered again to flames that flickered against<br />
the words from all the books I’ve ever read …</p>
<p>What kind of putrefactive model might<br />
that be? So all in all, what am I, again?<br />
The sky blankly reflected its intent:<br />
a harbor stained with chum.</p>
<p>O mother, please, I am exactly this:<br />
a misshapen vision of a man, a wraith<br />
slowly marching toward his death. So please.</p>
<p>I need you less and less, the specter says.<br />
The mother says: I have already died.<br />
Ascend O thorny beast so that I might ...</p>
<p><br />
5. The burden is now solely yours.</p>
<p>Not long from now neglected birds<br />
with plastic spoons lodged in their throats<br />
will snap their wings in concussive waves<br />
and splinter through the centuries. Who wears<br />
the <em>au fait</em> ears? The years have been unkind.</p>
<p>The dead can speak and may be speaking now.<br />
The changing light is you who will not move.<br />
The shadows slide in predicative ways.</p>
<p>We owe so much to the systems we devise:<br />
the tick and rumble of optical space,<br />
a frequency of imaginary theorems,<br />
patterns cut and stitched from cosmic fabric.</p>
<p>Fish mark time through an ancient luster passing over its gills.</p>
<p>My eyes were once carbuncular and scaled.<br />
My flesh is stunned with delight.<br />
My pain is all and stakes a modest claim.</p>
<p>So give me what is mine and retreat into<br />
your dolor, brief as it may be. It’s known<br />
and real. This body can only hold a moment.</p>
<p><br />
6. The inaccuracies of reflection.</p>
<p>Designs thrust upon our minds,<br />
cut tendrils of thought, denature<br />
the standing order of things: a stitching hum:<br />
a frayed system in desperate need of repair.</p>
<p>The threads are worn and synthetically made.<br />
The dyes bleed and color the air.<br />
The cloth betrays the image, softens edges.</p>
<p><br />
7. A vision stripped of humanity.</p>
<p>So how do I proceed with the grit of man<br />
lodged in the recesses of my mouth:<br />
a quarantined breath:<br />
retreating toward the only vanishing point?</p>
<p>(This lattice will unhinge and lengthen in empty space<br />
until the structure is no longer clear.)</p>
<p>My dear, my dear, the strangeness is the first to go.<br />
And what was said or done is scrubbed<br />
by the abrasives of time and never understood, fully.</p>
<p>Or rather diluted and repeated by sycophants ...</p>
<p>The ground is strangely familiar and warm.<br />
My body warms it with the sun. Extend<br />
a welcome to the insects and worms, dear flesh.</p>
<p>This act must transcend not only this but those<br />
that came before and all such future acts.</p>
<p><br />
8. The coterie defines the thing.</p>
<p>The body is second hand:<br />
paraphrasaic, colored by the minds of others.</p>
<p>Jewelers cut their stones in meaningful shapes.<br />
Vultures close their eyes to carrion dreams.<br />
A crowd will form when vultures swallow rocks.<br />
Look how they wring their slender hands<br />
and pick at the fossils beneath their fingernails.<br />
Their bloated faces in familiar shades of gray,<br />
will imitate your nervous tics, your gaping mouth.</p>
<p>My purpose is not your own. You are the voice<br />
that resonates, are sacrosanct; and I?<br />
a burden scarcely worth defending …</p>
<p>I kiss your cheeks neatly.<br />
My friend, you’re all that I have, are all, I swear.</p>
<p>I know the whispering past spirits through your veins.<br />
I am the bruising lilac dressed for death.<br />
I am the breaking tide, the sounding sea;<br />
the pilgrim singing with the caravan.</p>
<p><br />
9. A vision as cosmogony.</p>
<p>It must, not only this act, but those<br />
that came before and all such future acts.</p>
<p>The dying is not the death: the fetal maw.</p>
<p>An unhinged jaw sings of nothingness.<br />
Come dance around the horns; come!<br />
This flaccid form arrests the ground …<br />
I hear a voice, a murmur, chalked and bent: an archetype.</p>
<p>The worms and weevils fix their tables.<br />
Sarcophagus! conceal my features, crack the salient grounds!</p>
<p>I am a form shuffling among<br />
the crush of flies that blot the sun,<br />
the first narrative woven in their wings.</p>
<p>Red apples fell beside the chattering birds<br />
and woke the shrunken earth. It grumbled for days.<br />
The heavens penetrated a fissure, stabbed<br />
the scraping rocks, discharged a fricative.<br />
(All language is a failed attempt at truth.)</p>
<p><br />
10. The platitudes are in want of clothes.</p>
<p>My tongue has failed me yet again.<br />
It is brittle and deformed: a spore.</p>
<p>The nexal force plants its eye in everything.<br />
I swim in oceanic and neritic waters, scrape the littoral sands.<br />
I am the wind; you are its effect.</p>
<p>You wanted the truth: a platitude<br />
or mathematical equation: coloring book designs …</p>
<p>I wish to cleave this skin and molt<br />
a mutable shell, translucent in the sun.<br />
The dusky foliage scrabbles through the vale.</p>
<p>Each stratum, each phyletic thread corrupts:<br />
is code for something else.</p>
<p><br />
11. The auguries of experience.</p>
<p>The sky burns bright with symmetry; the bridge<br />
is sinking in the slough; the rusted gates<br />
are sealed; my death should wish for something else.<br />
I see things decompose into their baser parts.<br />
I hear electrons sing.</p>
<p>Who finds me now in the wickets of my death<br />
will see a gross untruth: an amorphous form<br />
at odds with gravity, a fraud, a man whose life<br />
was nothing but an illness: a collection of mistaken velleities.</p>
<p><br />
12. To those who dwell in realms of day.</p>
<p>The shadows skip in merry fields<br />
where man and beast in tandem yields<br />
a soft relief against the sky<br />
that drops delicious whips of light<br />
on souls that act as Heaven’s shields.</p>
<p>The light bends round the ancient trees<br />
and creeps through grass by small degrees<br />
and floods the land like glistering seas.</p>
<p>And peals of mirth ring through the air<br />
and sting each ear clarion clear<br />
and strip away the muddy drum<br />
whose beat disguised the primal hum<br />
that radiates like solemn prayer.</p>
<p>And burning columns streak the skies,<br />
and blinding paths where angels rise<br />
and fall, attending to mortal cries.</p>
<p>In constant bloom the lilies are dressed<br />
and streams flash past or come to rest<br />
(a dalliance of infinity<br />
where time is but a vicinity)<br />
and lightness dusts the skylark’s nest.</p>
<p>And spirits wade in pools of joy<br />
where sorrows float like a darling toy<br />
that erupts abruptly for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>And bursting too is this perfect land<br />
carefully stitched by a governing hand,<br />
for one more frenzied and filled with fears<br />
where one can’t know minutes from years,<br />
and every vessel sails unmanned.</p>
<p><br />
13. To wanting souls who dwell in night.</p>
<p>A studied force propels the age<br />
though chaos reigns with equal rage<br />
where skittish men who twitch and stamp<br />
slink darkly through the damp,<br />
tormented by their self-made cage.</p>
<p>And through their eyes the world is black<br />
where light escapes and won’t come back<br />
unless yoked to thoughts that further the crack.</p>
<p>And sounds ring round that never cease:<br />
not those of happiness nor of peace,<br />
but anguished cries for help or war<br />
that cut the flesh: a violent score<br />
that drapes the soul in a caustic fleece.</p>
<p>And mordant knights with rusted swords<br />
design the flesh of insolent hoards<br />
who wait for counsel with their lords.</p>
<p>Where shrinking asphodels can cure<br />
low thoughts and rinse foul memories pure<br />
(which makes the past a jubilee<br />
to accent present misery)<br />
and force all history to blur.</p>
<p>Where talismans attract low priests<br />
who slither with their baleful beasts<br />
to tables set with corporal feasts.</p>
<p>And yet this world has an earthly feel,<br />
an intense malaise, a tired reel<br />
of pictures slogging through the mind<br />
like crooked trees in a blizzard-blind<br />
field; a crow on a broken wheel.</p>
<p><br />
14. For souls that sleep in beams of light.</p>
<p>And in the sky I saw a sign<br />
of burning towns and burning fields<br />
and soldiers marching by design<br />
and children crying on their shields<br />
and through the smoke appeared a face<br />
whose mouth had moved but no words came;<br />
whose startled eyes were stunned by grace<br />
and wanted neither wealth nor fame.</p>
<p>And peals of thunder filled the air<br />
and minor creatures sought high ground.<br />
A rider found the blackest mare<br />
to meet his god without a sound.<br />
And in the clouds ran martyrs’ blood<br />
and in their tears a sparkling flood.</p>
<p>And in the sky the sign was I.</p>
<p>And I was burning by design:<br />
and I rumbled into sound,<br />
then sound transfigured into a sign<br />
like smoke concealing trampled ground.<br />
And I became a paltry sum<br />
of all things past for I am trapped<br />
in the just-uttered continuum<br />
where future’s door is securely clasped.</p>
<p>And in the end it is a word,<br />
a string of symbols and nothing more<br />
that all creation summarily heard:<br />
an abstract thought on reason’s door.<br />
Where frolicking lambs, <em>et cetera</em> …<br />
In beams of light, <em>et cetera</em> …</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
