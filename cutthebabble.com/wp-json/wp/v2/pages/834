Much like Chinua\u2019s greedy fly that follows a corpse into the grave, I skipped my class and followed the two men into the seminar they were attending on our campus. They were at the University of Florida (where I taught) attending a week-long workshop of Black Writers during the BHM observances. I literally bumped into them in a faculty elevator at lunchtime, and recognized Chinua by his photo.<\/p>\n<p>Achebe kindly introduced Baldwin. But, barbarian engineer that I was, I\u2019d never heard of Baldwin: I ignored him; I only had eyes for Chinua. (When I queried Achebe about his first name, \u201cChinua,\u201d as I was wont to do with everybody, he explained: \u201c<em>Chinua\u2019lim ogu<\/em>\u201d \u2014 May God fight for me. And, no, he apologized, he was unable to come to my house for dinner due to prior commitments.) I smiled at the two men and went away, missing a rare chance to get acquainted with James Baldwin.<\/p>\n<p>Only last fall did I discover James Baldwin, the writer. I have read \u201cAnother Country\u201d and \u201cThe Fire Next Time.\u201d Boy! what a writer!! Reading Baldwin in full stride is like peering over the rim of a volcano in full wrath. His eloquent prose reminds one of the militant imagery in Julia Howe\u2019s lyrics for <em>The Battle Hymn of the Republic<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>I never knew what I missed all those years. Concerning Baldwin I was as clueless as the proverbial nerd parodied in the following allegory:<\/p>\n<p>(<em>Jane, a coed majoring in literature<\/em>): \u201cJohn\u2019s your name? Do you like Rudyard Kipling?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>(<em>John, an engineering major<\/em>): \u201cI dunno. I never kipled in any kind of yard before.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>February 03, 2017:\u00a0 MEMORY OF A GREAT BLACK WRITER I met James Baldwin and Chinua Achebe together in 1980.
