Unlike Len\u2019s honorable and efficient wife Magda, Trish was articulate and feisty. Len and Trish embark on a torrid love affair that takes them to the stratosphere, with adventures in the U.S.A. and Europe punctuated by epochal events such as \u201c9\/11\u201d and Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster, which they observed together from vantage perspectives provided by his work schedule. Len kept up hopes and plans to get his family well situated, as dictated by his traditional African background, before he would follow his heart and cleave to Trish. But by the time he finally left his 44-year-old marriage, Trish had quietly defected to someone else.<\/div>\n<div>Len pulled all stops to woo her back, but she spurned all his efforts. When he persisted, she turned truculent adversary and sued him for stalking. A perplexed Len now examined Trish\u2019s behavior and was horrified to find that the real Trish Adoja was a consummate con artist: her years of pretended affection was a camouflage for serial predation on a specific, predictable type of man.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>About the Author<\/b><\/div>\n<p>Lyn Thomas is an engineer by training who has worked as a scientist and academic.
