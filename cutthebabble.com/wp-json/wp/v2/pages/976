That was until my three sons opened my eyes through their persistent inquiry. Their curiosity rekindled my interest in our origins, and what I\u2019ve learned convinces me that we should not let strangers (especially strangers with their agenda rooted in prejudice) write our history.<\/p>\n<p>Now in their 30s and 40s and born in the USA, my sons lived in Nigeria only during the decade (1981\u20131990) when I went back to teach in Nigerian universities; now they are eager to learn about our provenance, culture, language, and cosmology. I regret I am not able to help them very far on that quest. They all foolishly followed me into engineering but kept up lively pastime pursuits in history, literature, and the social sciences. (Not to brag, but the oldest wrote an award-winning book of poetry and also now edits two journals of poetry; they also have substantial publications in science &amp; engineering fields.)<\/p>\n<p>The two oldest boys began asking me years ago about the <em>Nok<\/em> archeological finds, ancient iron smelting in northern Igboland, and then <em>Nsibidi<\/em> (the ancient Igbo system of sacred calligraphy); the boys keep alerting me to various books on Igbo culture written by more recent Nigerian scholars.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<em>Nsibi<\/em>-what?\u201d I wondered, and started exploring.
