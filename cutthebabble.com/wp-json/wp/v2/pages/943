His father\u2019s name was \u201cOgbuji,\u201d a formal and high chieftaincy title taken by the most successful farmer in the clan. My father adopted his primary name, Thomas, through conversion to the Catholic faith. The new convert is predictably zealous and my father was no different.<\/p>\n<p>When the time came to name his own children Papa chose to give them all European names. His first son was Justin; following Justin were my two sisters, Roseline and Louisa; then came I, and I was named Linus; then came Marcellus, and finally Cletus. Note that all his sons were given the names of Catholic Popes; Linus was the direct successor to Peter the Apostle. My father and his peers belonged to the generation of Nigerians that was indoctrinated by European missionaries; they were taught that a child must bear the name of a \u201csaint\u201d listed in the Church canon.<\/p>\n<p>I belong to the generation that began to turn away from that colonial mindset. All my children and their children were given Igbo names. Our aim in so doing was to affirm that the cosmology of our people was no less valid than the quaint beliefs of the English, Irish, French, Dutch, or what have you. Every Igbo name carries a meaning or message. The name given to a baby is always reflexive of the circumstances of its birth.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our eldest son is Uchenna (<em>Uche<\/em> for short, pronounced \u201cOu-chay\u201d).
