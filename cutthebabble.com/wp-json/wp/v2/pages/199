US English is especially quirky. In the book Mother Tongue &amp; How it Got That Way an oriental businessman is quoted as telling his countrymen not to be daunted because they might make mistakes when expressing themselves to Americans in English: \u201cThey cannot speak their own language, anyway!\u201d he said. And right he is too. There is a lot of babbling in the USA! While Americanism may be charming and catchy in colloquial usage, some of it is downright incongruous in written communication. The distinction between colloquial and written English is often ignored in the USA these days. The rot is spreading furiously now that everyone feels emancipated from restraint and entitled to write as they please without oversight.<\/p>\n<p>English language is, so to speak, the final frontier of an all-too-familiar steam-rolling American dominance in world affairs. British imperialism planted English language in all corners of the globe and US military, economic, and social dominance consolidates that trend, making English a second language for nearly everyone on the globe. But whereas the British required all users of the language to conform to a rigid structure in grammar and syntax, American English is free-wheeling, in keeping with the irrepressible individuality of Americans. As the bold initiators of change in our world, with boundless drive and a pronounced disregard for they way things are done anywhere else, Americans are changing English rapidly \u2015 for better and for worse. US English is, ultimately, an expression of the hegemony of a peerless and pushy people.<\/p>\n<p>At first the US immigrant from a former British colony is intimidated by the honey-smooth flow of the American accent. He starts to copy the style, warts and all, just to be \u201cwith it\u201d and to get along. He begins to pronounce the second month of the year as \u201cFerb-you-wary\u201d (which seems to be OK because even British commentators now use that pronunciation). Then he gets a note from his college-educated boss saying \u201cWe may loose money do to your error,\u201d and he begins to wonder: Does anyone care anymore? Do Americans use the dictionary? Do they really learn English in high school? Does the use of correct English matter at all?<\/p>\n<p>Declension of pronouns is muddled \u2015 so that presidential candidate Bill Clinton once kicked off his cross-country bus tour with the folksy message to rally attendees: \u201cIf you have any questions send them to Al Gore and I.\u2026\u201d (Did anyone understand that Mr. Clinton was saying: \u201cSend your questions to Al Gore and\/or send them to I\u201d?) Verb conjugation is going too. \u201cIf I was you\u201d is much more common than the correct formulation, \u201cIf I were you.\u201d We may overlook oddities of colloquial expression; otherwise we alienate too many people, for instance by observing that the \u201cdee-poh\u201d in Home Depot (or the \u201cdeb-you\u201d for debut) is really neither French nor English but a higgledy-piggledy amalgam of both languages. But what of errors in written communication? Should we ignore them too? Must I guess the meaning behind your sentence? If so, at what point shall we become mutually unintelligible?<\/p>\n<p>Ask Johnny how he\u2019s doing and he will reply: \u201cI\u2019m doing good.\u201d Not long ago that would have meant that he is performing charitable deeds! Perhaps because of its ending in \u201cly,\u201d the word \u201clikely\u201d has morphed entirely from adjective to adverb. Casting a sentence in the subjunctive mood was always challenging at best with its troublesome requirement of a verb in the infinitive tense; now it is altogether a lost art. Actually, it has been said that whereas the British have only recently began to fudge the subjunctive mood, Americans never bought into it in the first place.<br \/>\nAmong the most noticeable changes in written English (one hesitates to call modern American popular writing \u201cliterature\u201d) is, that the hyphen is following the semi-colon and the serial comma into oblivion. Those changes in punctuation style are accelerated by the proliferation of text editing features embedded in nearly all software and textual apps we use. If you are reading this text on an electronic screen you will notice several words or phrases underlined in blue or red. Many instances of such machine editing turn out to be wrong, and if you click on the underlined passage you are apt to receive a wild and horrible suggestion for an alternative! All it shows is that those hidden text editors are no better-informed than the persons who wrote them in the first place. I almost always ignore all the editing prompts in MS Word. (Most useless and ubiquitous is the prompt that says, \u201cFragmentary; consider revising.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>FUNDRAISING, SHOPLIFTING and THANKSGIVING are similar constructions: in each case a noun is formed by plugging a gerund onto another noun, in the lego style that is quite common in the German language. One can imagine that not long ago the preferred style was to connect the noun and gerund with a hyphen; however, the hyphen is becoming extinct. If you change the gerund to its verb of origin the similarity between the three words vanishes. \u201cThey shoplifted\u201d is OK but not \u201cThey fundraised\u201d or \u201cThey thanksgave.\u201d If you wonder why that is so then you are getting to the heart of the matter, the very spirit of this blog. What is right or wrong in English language is often not a matter of logic, of rhyme or reason. Good English is to a large extent idiomatic, and idioms are a matter of conformity, acquired by learning (aka imitation) rather than by I-too-can-improvise derring-do.<\/p>\n<p>But while tinkering with English grammar and syntax is not for the dilettante, expanding the vocabulary with home-minted words is a different matter. Now and then we find new words injected into the language by some intrepid souls. Recently a <em>blogger<\/em> dismissed the contrary views of an opponent as \u201cmere hopium\u201d (thus fusing the two words \u2018hope\u2019 and \u2018opium\u2019 to create a neat, derogatory tag that means essentially addiction to unreasonable hope). Note that <em><strong>blog<\/strong><\/em>, and <em><strong>tweet<\/strong><\/em> and their derivatives <em>blogger<\/em> and <em>tweeter<\/em>, etc. are themselves brave recent coinages spawned by new technology (just like \u2018broadcast\u2019 and \u2018broadcaster,\u2019 which passed into Queen\u2019s English with the onset of radio communication right after World War II).<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>CONFUSION OVER PARTS OF SPEECH<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(Posted April 30, 2015)<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<figure id=\"attachment_35\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/When-Life-was-Peachy1.jpg\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-35\" src=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/When-Life-was-Peachy1-251x300.jpg\" alt=\"Once Upon a Good Book\" width=\"251\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/When-Life-was-Peachy1-251x300.jpg 251w, http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/When-Life-was-Peachy1-857x1024.jpg 857w, http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/When-Life-was-Peachy1.jpg 1250w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 251px) 100vw, 251px\" \/><\/a><figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\">When Life was Peachy!<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p><strong>Everybody knows the difference between nouns and adjectives, right? Wrong\u2026.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Electric Bill or Electricity Bill?<br \/>\nAn electric bill is one that shocks you, and it may not be for electricity consumed. A $10,000.00 water bill would be considered \u201celectric,\u201d even if you are Bill Gates. The bill that comes from your power utility is your <strong>electricity bill<\/strong>; it is not electric if it is for $1.50.<\/p>\n<p>Athletic or Athletics?<br \/>\nThe man that controls and regulates sports in your high school: Is he your \u201cAthletic Director\u201d or your <strong>\u201cAthletics Director\u201d?<\/strong> It depends. If he is muscle-bound and presses 200 lbs., he may qualify to be called \u201cathletic\u201d (which means the same as \u201csportive\u201d); but if he is a 250-lb couch potato that oversees sporting activities from the cushy comfort of an air-conditioned office, the best he can be is an Athletics Director. A school may have a <strong>physics<\/strong> or <strong>mathematics<\/strong> or <strong>athletics<\/strong> teacher (in each case a noun). Those nouns are always used in the plural, never in the singular, so that a \u201cphysic\u201d or \u201cmathematic\u201d or \u201cathletic\u201d teacher makes no sense.<\/p>\n<p>Are you \u201csix foot tall\u201d or \u201csix feet tall\u201d?<br \/>\nThe <em>foot<\/em> in \u201csix-foot man\u201d is really an adjective. It is called an adjectival noun because, while it is a noun, it functions as an adjective in that construction (qualifying man). It is like saying someone is a house painter: \u201chouse\u201d is an adjectival noun here, qualifying painter.<\/p>\n<p>So, \u201c<strong>I am six foot tall\u201d makes no sense<\/strong> really: it uses an adjective (foot) where it should use a plural noun (feet). A six-foot man is six feet (plural noun) tall; a woman who measures five feet and six inches in height is a \u201cfive-foot-and-six-inch woman\u201d; and a child that weighs fifty pounds is a fifty-pound child. Similarly, a twenty-dollar lunch costs twenty dollars (plural noun). We seem to get confused only when it comes to height! Nobody can be \u201c6 (or 5, etc.) foot tall,\u201d Such a unit of height does not exist. If your height is six feet, then: You are a six footer, a six foot person, or a person six feet tall. Just keep in mind \u201cnoun versus adjective\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t get it wrong.<\/p>\n<p>Transitive &amp; Intransitive Verbs<br \/>\nDo you <strong>lie<\/strong> down or <strong>lay<\/strong> down? It depends on what is lying or being laid. Americans seem to tip-toe around the verb \u201cto lay\u201d because of its sexually loaded nuance. But as children we learned the <em>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John prayer<\/em>: \u201c\u2026Before I lay me down to sleep \/ I give my soul to Christ to keep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LIE is an intransitive verb. In present tense , \u201cI lie down\u201d (in past tense, \u201cI lay down\u201d). But LAY is a transitive verb because it takes an object. Thus, a child who is ready to sleep will first <strong>lay her book<\/strong> down and then <strong>lie down<\/strong> (or lay herself down). So, \u201cI will lay down on the couch\u201d is confusing, unless you are a hen laying eggs.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, one version of <strong><em>The Red River Valley<\/em><\/strong> song lyrics says: \u201cFor I know you are taking the sunshine \/ That has lied in our path for a while.\u201d That is bad English; the last line should read \u201c\u2026 that has lain in our path for a while.\u201d Again, the tenses of the 2 verbs are: LIE: Now it <em><strong>lies <\/strong><\/em>in our path; yesterday it <em><strong>lay;<\/strong><\/em> for years it has <em><strong>lain;<\/strong><\/em> tomorrow it will <strong><em>lie<\/em><\/strong>; etc. LAY: Now I <strong><em>lay<\/em><\/strong> it down; yesterday I <em><strong>laid<\/strong><\/em> it down, for years I\u2019ve <strong><em>laid<\/em><\/strong> it down; tomorrow\u2026 <strong><em>lay<\/em><\/strong>. But don\u2019t confuse them with the verb to tell a lie: I lie, I lied, I\u2019ve lied, I will lie; etc.<\/p>\n<p>Prepositions<br \/>\nSome prepositions are used exclusively or preferentially with some verbs in certain contexts. Thus you \u201c<strong>wait for<\/strong>\u201d somebody (if you are biding time for that somebody to be ready to do something); but you \u201c<strong>wait on<\/strong>\u201d somebody if you are a waiter in a restaurant, an attendant in a shop, or a teller in a bank, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen the case of \u201c<strong>off<\/strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>on<\/strong>\u201d in a previous post at this blog site. Each is a complete preposition: \u201cI put the book on the table,\u201d or \u201cI won $5 off him in a bet.\u201d In this context <strong>\u201coff-of\u201d is meaningless<\/strong> (as in \u201cTake your hands off-of me\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Another surprising error is the saying \u201cIt\u2019s not that big of a deal.\u201d What is <em><strong>of<\/strong><\/em> doing there? The correct expression is, \u201cIt\u2019s not that big a deal.\u201d Shuffling \u201ca deal that big\u201d to read as \u201cthat big a deal\u201d is good enough; you don\u2019t have to insert \u201cof\u201d anywhere in it.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>TAUTOLOGY<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>(Posted April 08, 2015)<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_169\" style=\"width: 278px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/06-02-15.jpg\" data-rel=\"penci-gallery-image-content\" ><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-169\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-169\" src=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/06-02-15-268x300.jpg\" alt=\"Older and Wiser!\" width=\"268\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/06-02-15-268x300.jpg 268w, http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/06\/06-02-15-914x1024.jpg 914w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 268px) 100vw, 268px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-169\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Older and Wiser!<\/p><\/div>\n<p>Everybody now feels compelled to say, \u201cincluding but not limited to\u2026\u201d because it sounds sophisticated: all lawyers insert it into contracts and letters to impress laypersons, or more likely because they are paid by the word: A lawyer will charge you $350.00 for drafting a one-paragraph \u201cCease and Desist\u201d letter to your adversary. And so the rot spreads because lawyers are the most ubiquitous and most glorified professionals in the USA. An American is more likely to go through life without needing a doctor than without needing a lawyer! Lawyers are very important role models in the USA. And lawyers simply love obfuscatory verbiage because they make documents sound impressive.<\/p>\n<p>I scratch my head whenever I see \u201cincluding but not limited to\u2026.\u201d The word \u201cincluding\u201d is completely adequate here; it needs no bells and whistles. The clothes in my closet include shirts, but they are not limited to shirts: I have pants and jackets too. It is IMPOSSIBLE to find a case where \u201cincluding\u201d implies that what is included constitutes the whole category under reference. To see this clearly, draw a rectangle and inside it draw a circle. Your rectangle includes the circle but is not limited to the circle: there are things (areas) that lie within the rectangle but outside the circle.<\/p>\n<p>So whenever I see that \u201c\u2026but not limited to\u201d I delete it. My lawyer does not seem to notice the deletion; or he does not mind because he knows it is totally tautological: it adds no meaning or clarification.<\/p>\n<p>What of \u201cin any way, shape, or form\u201d? What distinction do \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cform\u201d add to the phrase? How about \u201cin and of and by itself\u201d? \u201cIn itself \u201cis adequate and everything else there is tautology. While we may blame such chain-link deployment of prepositions on lawyers eager to impress us, there is a new kind of preposition that is more baffling, and the origin of which is more nebulous. English usage in America seems to have evolved a new preposition, \u201coffof\u201d: as in \u201cGet your hand offof me!\u201d Or is it off-of? Ofof? Of-of? I guess I\u2019ve never seen it in writing, so anything goes here. What is wrong with saying just \u201coff\u201d (\u201cGet your hands off me\u201d)?<\/p>\n<p>Such creations start when someone makes a mistake and others latch onto it as a new style. An apparently even more recent creation is \u201cThe problem is is\u2026\u201d What is the second \u201cis\u201d doing here? Someone probably heard a speaker say \u201cWhat this is, is a mistake,\u201d (which is correct English) and the listener (who cannot \u201chear\u201d the comma after the first \u201cis\u201d) then thought that \u201cis is\u201d is cute. A similar nonsense is \u201cthe reason being is\u2026.\u201d One can say, \u201cI came late. The reason is that I missed my bus.\u201d Or you can join the two sentences into one by changing is to being: \u201cI came late, the reason being that I missed my bus.\u201d But you can\u2019t keep both is and being together right there (and say: I came late, the reason being is\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One suspects that such mangled sentence formulation comes from the American habit of taking our cues from \u201ccelebrities.\u201d Celebrities are persons who have achieved fame through their hard work (one hopes) in specific, narrow spheres of human endeavor. Such achievement does not make them all-round gurus. In fact, in most cases a celebrity status was attained through the habit of practicing just one role in life and, unfortunately, devoting less time or none at all to education. The child who watches lots of movies but pays scant attention to her English teacher at school is likely to become an adult who speaks gobbledygook!<\/p>\n<p>American children (and increasingly children the world over) learn much more from television than from school, for two reasons. One is that much more time is devoted to TV watching than to school work or home work. Another is that the presenters on TV (including actors especially) are spellbinding because they are cute, while the harried teachers in class are drab. So perhaps our society can ameliorate he problem by requiring that script writers for TV programs be quite literate and competent!<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>A FEMALE MAN?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>(Posted March 11, 2015)<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>WHO IS A &#8220;GERWOMAN\u201d?<\/p>\n<p>The ascendancy of women in occupations previously dominated by men is brewing some headaches in nomenclature.<\/p>\n<p>When I was in college ages ago, the head of a committee or of an academic department used to be called \u201cchairman.\u201d Then an intrepid crop of trailblazing women rose to those tasks and we began to say: \u201cchairwoman,\u201d \u201cchairperson,\u201d or just \u201cchairman.\u201d I believe we are still vacillating between those options. But then, at an animated campus round-table, I heard a feisty woman describe her field of study as \u201cherstory.\u201d Only the knowing smirks around the table revealed to me what she meant.

US English is especially quirky. An ad for <em>Rosetta Stone<\/em> (the language learning tutorial) states that the average American does not speak a second language. That may not matter these days when the whole world is gravitating to English language under the spell of America. What may be troubling is the question of whether the average American has sufficient mastery of English, especially for written communication.\u00a0 In the book MOTHER TONGUE AND HOW IT GOT THAT WAY, an oriental businessman is quoted as telling his countrymen not to be daunted because they might make mistakes when expressing themselves to Americans in English: \u201cThey cannot speak their own language, anyway!\u201d he said. He is right: US English can seem like a lot of babbling! While we may find Americanisms charming and catchy in colloquial usage, some of it is incongruous in written communication. The distinction between colloquial and written English is often ignored in the USA these days. The rot is spreading furiously now that everyone feels emancipated from restraint and entitled to write as they please without oversight.<\/p>\n<p>English language is, so to speak, the final frontier of an all-too-familiar steam-rolling American dominance in world affairs. British imperialism planted English language in all corners of the globe and US military, economic, and social dominance consolidates that trend, making English a second language for nearly everyone on the globe. But whereas the British required all users of the language to conform to a rigid structure in grammar and syntax, US English is free-wheeling, in keeping with the irrepressible individuality of Americans. As bold initiators of change in our world, with boundless drive and a cultivated disregard for how things are done anywhere else, Americans are changing English rapidly \u2015 for better and for worse. US English is, ultimately, an expression of the hegemony of a peerless and pushy people.<\/p>\n<p>At first the US immigrant from a former British colony is intimidated by the honey-smooth flow of the American accent. He starts to copy the style, warts and all, just to be \u201cwith it\u201d and to get along. He begins to pronounce the second month of the year as \u201cFerb-you-wary\u201d (which seems to be OK because even British commentators now use that pronunciation). Then he gets a note from his college-educated boss saying \u201cWe may loose [sic] work days do [sic] to bad weather,\u201d and he begins to wonder: Does anyone care anymore? Do Americans use the dictionary? Do they really learn English in high school? Does the use of correct English matter at all?<\/p>\n<p>Declension of pronouns is muddled \u2015 so that presidential candidate Bill Clinton once kicked off his cross-country bus tour with the folksy message to rally attendees: \u201cIf you have any questions send them to Al Gore and I.\u2026\u201d (Did anyone understand that Mr. Clinton was saying: \u201cSend your questions to Al Gore and\/or send them to I\u201d?) Verb conjugation is going too. \u201cIf I was you\u201d is much more common than the correct formulation, \u201cIf I were you.\u201d We may overlook oddities of colloquial expression; otherwise we alienate too many people, for instance by observing that the \u201cdee-poh\u201d in Home Depot (or the \u201cdeb-you\u201d for debut) is really neither French nor English but a higgledy-piggledy amalgam of both languages. But what of errors in written communication? Should we ignore them too? Must I guess the meaning behind your sentence? If so, at what point shall we become mutually unintelligible?<\/p>\n<p>Ask Johnny how he\u2019s doing and he will reply: \u201cI\u2019m doing good.\u201d Not long ago that would have meant that he was performing charitable deeds! Perhaps because of its ending in \u201cly,\u201d the word \u201clikely\u201d has morphed entirely from adjective to adverb. Casting a sentence in the subjunctive mood was always challenging at best with its troublesome requirement of a verb in the infinitive tense; now it is altogether a lost art. Actually, it has been said that whereas the British have only recently begun to fudge the subjunctive mood, Americans never bought into it in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Among the most noticeable changes in written English (one hesitates to call modern American popular writing \u201cliterature\u201d) is, that the hyphen is following the semi-colon and the serial comma into oblivion. Those changes in punctuation style are accelerated by the proliferation of text editing features embedded in nearly all software and textual apps we use. If you are reading this text on an electronic screen you will notice several words or phrases underlined in blue or red. Many instances of such machine editing turn out to be wrong, and if you click on the underlined passage you are apt to receive a wild and horrible suggestion for an alternative! All it shows is that those hidden text editors are no better-informed than the persons who wrote them in the first place. I almost always ignore all the editing prompts in MS Word. (Most useless and ubiquitous is the prompt that says, \u201cFragmentary; consider revising.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>FUNDRAISING, SHOPLIFTING and THANKSGIVING are similar constructions: in each case a noun is formed by plugging a gerund onto another noun, in the lego style that is quite common in the German language. One can imagine that not long ago the preferred style was to connect the noun and gerund with a hyphen; however, the hyphen is becoming extinct. If you change the gerund to its verb of origin the similarity between the three words vanishes. \u201cThey shoplifted\u201d is OK but not \u201cThey fundraised\u201d or \u201cThey thanksgave.\u201d If you wonder why that is so then you are getting to the heart of the matter, the very spirit of this blog. What is right or wrong in English language is often not a matter of logic, of rhyme or reason. Good English is to a large extent idiomatic, and idioms are a matter of conformity, acquired by learning (aka imitation) rather than by I-too-can-improvise derring-do.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<\/p>\n<p><strong>MIND YOUR LANGUAGE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div class=\"entry-content\">\n<p>This is a new site, full of hope and trepidation!
