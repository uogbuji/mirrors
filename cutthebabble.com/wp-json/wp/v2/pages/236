Unlike Len\u2019s honorable and efficient wife Magda, Trish was articulate and feisty. Len and Trish embark on a torrid love affair that takes them to the stratosphere, with adventures in the U.S.A. and Europe punctuated by epochal events such as \u201c9\/11\u201d and Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster, which they observed together from vantage perspectives provided by his work schedule. Len kept up hopes and plans to get his family well situated, as dictated by his traditional African background, before he would follow his heart and cleave to Trish. But by the time he finally left his 44-year-old marriage, Trish had quietly defected to someone else.<\/div>\n<div>Len pulled all stops to woo her back, but she spurned all his efforts. When he persisted, she turned truculent adversary and sued him for stalking. A perplexed Len now examined Trish\u2019s behavior and was horrified to find that the real Trish Adoja was a consummate con artist: her years of pretended affection was a camouflage for serial predation on a specific, predictable type of man.<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div><b>About the Author<\/b><\/div>\n<p>Lyn Thomas is an engineer by training who has worked as a scientist and academic.

I thought it was so, so excellently written (a few minor editing things but nothing too major) by far one of the more \u2018beautiful\u2019 narratives I\u2019ve come across in a while. Word choice in Literary fiction is everything and here it is done quite well. After an admittedly slow start for me, I soon became invested and wondered how it would all play out\u2026 as I was continually trying to figure out what was really going on with the characters\u2026 love when a book does that to me! I was genuinely surprised at a few things that happened, and thought the continued, building tension and character development was great. Would love to read more from Lyn Thomas in the future, and definitely recommend reading for fans of literary fiction\/suspense\/drama\/romance.<\/div>\n<div id=\"review-like\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"leftAlignedImage\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/37230309-elizabeth-brown\"><img src=\"https:\/\/d.gr-assets.com\/users\/1416722724p2\/37230309.jpg\" alt=\"37230309\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span class=\"reviewer\"><a class=\"userReview\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/37230309-elizabeth-brown\">Elizabeth Brown<\/a><\/span>&#8216;s review<\/p>\n<div class=\"right dtreviewed greyText smallText\">Jul 27, 15<\/div>\n<div><\/div>\n<div class=\"rating\"><a class=\" staticStars stars_4\" title=\"really liked it\">4 of 5 stars<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"reviewText mediumText description\">this book by Lyn Thomas was terrific! Once I started reading I didn\u2019t want to stop until I\u2019d finished the whole thing. It pulls you in from the beginning, and I really enjoyed the author\u2019s \u201cvoice\u201d and style of writing. The complex, interweaving plotlines were well-developed and not predictable, and I liked the dialogue between the characters that moved the plot forward at an addicting speed. The characters were all interesting and well-written, and although there were some grammatical and punctuation errors, it wasn\u2019t anything that really bothered me. I\u2019d love to read more from Lyn Thomas in the future!

I haven\u2019t read anything like that in a long time, if ever. Totally crazy twists and characters that keep you fully invested the whole way through. And the Writing! Lyn Thomas is a talented writer for sure and the use of the 3rd person omniscient here was great because we were able to see a wide perspective and get in the characters heads. And For once it seemed like the characters were anything but the stock, ordinary typical hero\/protag guys (our lead is an older man in his mid-60\u2019s), and I don\u2019t want to focus too much on it, but I thought the Nigerian aspect was pretty cool too. All came together to create a fresh-feeling novel that was out of the ordinary and kept me hooked throughout. This was a standalone book(not a part of any series, it appears), but I hope the author Lyn Thomas writes more like this in the future. I\u2019d be reading it!<\/div>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><a class=\"leftAlignedImage\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/37230734-essie-harmon\"><img src=\"https:\/\/d.gr-assets.com\/users\/1422061299p2\/37230734.jpg\" alt=\"37230734\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span class=\"reviewer\"><a class=\"userReview\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/37230734-essie-harmon\">Essie Harmon<\/a><\/span>&#8216;s review<\/p>\n<div class=\"right dtreviewed greyText smallText\">Jul 23, 15<\/div>\n<div class=\"rating\"><a class=\" staticStars stars_4\" title=\"really liked it\">4 of 5 stars<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"reviewText mediumText description\">4.5 stars<br \/>\nThis was the first book I\u2019ve read by this author Lyn Thomas, but I certainly hope it\u2019s not the last! She has a gift for writing descriptive and life-like scenes that make us feel like we are really there inside the story, as opposed to it all just being \u201ctold\u201d to us, as so many rookie authors make the mistake of doing. I like that this book didn\u2019t feel stale or derivative, but instead like a new niche of literary drama that serves well to help diversify a somewhat cookie-cutter genre (in my opinion). It was very well-edited (I notice these things!) And I personally would have preferred more dialogue spaced throughout the narrative as it got quite dense at times. But I loved how it all wrapped up and overall the entire novel was one that I thought was well-crafted and delivered an emotional win.<\/div>\n<div class=\"reviewText mediumText description\">\n<hr \/>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"reviewText mediumText description\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"reviewText mediumText description\">\n<p><a class=\"leftAlignedImage\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/36685066-laura\"><img src=\"https:\/\/d.gr-assets.com\/users\/1415328271p2\/36685066.jpg\" alt=\"36685066\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<div>\n<p><span class=\"reviewer\"><a class=\"userReview\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/user\/show\/36685066-laura\">Laura<\/a><\/span>&#8216;s review<\/p>\n<div class=\"right dtreviewed greyText smallText\">Jul 23, 15<\/div>\n<div class=\"rating\"><a class=\" staticStars stars_5\" title=\"it was amazing\">5 of 5 stars<\/a><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>From the opening pages of \u201cPreying Mantis\u201d by Lyn Thomas I knew it would be different from the books I\u2019ve been reading lately and I was right! Ms. Thomas writes so beautifully\u2026 almost lyrical, poetic prose that sucks us right in. She sets of the scene and characterizations in a skillful way that not only engages the senses but creates great visualizations and elicits emotional investments. I truly cared about the characters\u2019 fates, and was shocked at certain things (no spoilers). Len is great\u2026 love the cultural influence and the fact that the MC is older. An interesting and diverse cast of characters, along with several intriguing plotlines interwoven against unique setting makes this a memorable read for me.
