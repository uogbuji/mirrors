But no matter, we will find another country to invade: you can bet on it. Venezuela? Iran? Who knows? Predation is so much in our blood that even Obama, who came to power with a pacific manifesto, blew our last chance for peaceful greatness and ended up as much a warmonger as any predecessor. Now we have a caveman administration lacking the smarts to do anything remotely constructive\u2014except building a wall.<\/p>\n<p>But why is fighting foreign wars now the sole ambition of the USA? Well, you have no doubt heard from the pundits (US and world) that present consumption rates of the world\u2019s resources are not sustainable. In other words, not every family in the world can aspire to 1-acre homes, with four-six cars and 65-inch TV sets\u2026 like Norte Americanos.<\/p>\n<p>The USA constitutes 4.2% of the world\u2019s population and comprises 9% of the land area; Russia is comparable but a bit sparser, with 3.3% of the population &amp; occupying 11% of the land area; and China\u2019s 23% of the population occupies 6% of the land area. Now, the USA consumes 29.5% of the world\u2019s energy resources while China comes second at 20%; Russia is way down at 5.5%. On a per capita or per unit area basis, then, US consumption soars way off the charts. (Those stats are from research &amp; survey reports available on the net.)<\/p>\n<p>So, next time you see those cock-&amp;-bull justifications for our endless predatory wars in foreign lands (\u201cWMD,\u201d \u201cchemical\/biological weapons,\u201d \u201cethnic cleansing,\u201d \u201ccivilization,\u201d \u201cdemocracy,\u201d \u201cevil empire,\u201d \u201caxis of evil,\u201d \u201cterrorism,\u201d \u201chuman rights,\u201d etc.) don\u2019t be misled: just remember the figures above. An addict stops at nothing to satisfy their craving: not begging, prostitution, robbery or even murder. That\u2019s why we fight so much all over the globe. The long and short of it is that we just covet other people\u2019s share of the bounties of the earth! \u00a0We gotta have it!!! And by \u201cwe\u201d I don\u2019t mean just our government! Trump is a transient. We must look in the mirror.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ADDICTED TO AFFLUENCE Syria and North Korea may not pan out for us: one found a powerful protector; the other is now crouched, unyielding, matching us snarl-for-snarl, roar-for-roar with a&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1096"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1096"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1096\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1100,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1096\/revisions\/1100"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1096"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
