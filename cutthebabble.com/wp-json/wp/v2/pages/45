Trish was articulate and feisty, while Magda, his honorable and efficient wife, was staid and low-key. Len and Trish embark on a torrid love affair that takes them to the stratosphere, with adventures in the U.S. and Europe punctuated by epochal events such as \u201c9\/11\u201d and Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster, which they observed together from vantage perspectives provided by his work schedule. Len kept up hopes and plans to get his family well situated before he would follow his heart and propose to Trish; the constraints of his traditional African background would not let him do otherwise.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>But by the time Len finally broke out of his 44-year-old marriage, Trish had quietly defected to someone else. Len pulled all stops to woo her back, but she spurned all his efforts. And when he persisted she turned truculent adversary and sued him to court for \u201charassment.\u201d Now perplexed, Len examined Trish\u2019s behavior closely and was horrified at what he found: the real Trish Adoja had none of the virtues his fevered imagination had attributed to her all along; she was a consummate con artist. With hindsight Len embarked on an anguished review of her years of pretended affection \u2014and saw it all as a stupendous camouflage for her serial predation on a specific, predictable type of men.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The narrative is woven tight around three characters, all Nigerian \u00e9migr\u00e9s to the US, and all middle-class professionals. The book offers some insight into the socio-cultural dynamics of African elites as they struggle to meld into the American \u201cmelting pot.\u201d Theirs is a category of Americans whose tradition-suffused story is seldom told; but the underlying theme of love and betrayal is, of course, timeless and universal. There is a sub-theme of miscues and conflicts in the expected gender roles of modern romance.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em>The prose is at a higher level (to quote a reviewer) since the book is targeted at advanced readers of English language who also have a robust lexicon.<\/em><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Review <em>Prefix by INDIE BOOK REVIEWERS Manager: \u00a0 Hi,<\/em><\/strong><br \/>\n<strong><em>Good news I have the 6 reviews ready for you and they are all very positive!
