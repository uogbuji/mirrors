My horror &amp; disgust at the \u201cNew World Order\u201d has gone beyond the puerile Western governments of our day to the real sinister force of modern times: the brazen and holistic propaganda enterprise of Western media. Once the USA brands a country\u2019s leader an enemy (be he Aideed, Milosevic, Saddam, Khaddafi, Assa\u2019ad, or Maduro, etc.), our media begin a relentless chorus to demonize that leader, smothering all truth with an avalanche of propaganda. George Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d was said to be a parody of communism; but it is now a prophecy of Western hypocrisy.<\/p>\n<p>Tim is right: <strong><em>the West has a serious (perhaps lethal) problem with democracy<\/em><\/strong><strong>: <\/strong>unfortunately, it is being redefined NOW as a sinister mantra that means only \u201cgovernment that is approved by the USA.\u201d I remember when Margaret Thatcher went to war against Argentina over the Falklands\/Malvinas. The islanders were dragooned to the polls in the middle of a deadly war and instructed to vote in favor of staying British. Western media immediately hailed that act as \u201cSelf-Determination.\u201d But recently the Crimea (which has been historically a part of Russia) voted unanimously to leave Ukraine and rejoin Russia, and all the attack dogs of Western media denounced that exercise as \u201csham election\u201d and a land grab by Russia.<\/p>\n<p>No, Tim, my expressive friend, the West is not \u201cevil\u201d: I don\u2019t believe in fairies, good or bad. The West is being perverted once again by imperialistic governments and tendencies, this time aided by bad media \u201cpresstitutes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It is scary because governments may come and go, while the modern media is run by an invisible conglomerate that exists to sow discord everywhere for financial gain. The media in non-Western countries are always introduced with the prefix \u201cgovernment-controlled\u201d (so as to elicit our disdain for media that FOLLOWS the diktat of a government. But our nightmare is not that the media can toe a government\u2019s line; rather it is that the media now CONTROLS some powerful governments!<\/p>\n<p>Whenever the topic of \u201cterrorism\u201d comes up, for instance, I\u2019m amazed at the number of Americans who insist, \u201cTerrorists hate us because we are the richest and happiest people on earth.\u201d I quickly tell them the US standard of living is not higher than that in Scandinavia; and our quality of life is much poorer than that of Scandinavians (when insecurity and societal strife are factored in); and yet, I point out, \u201cterrorists\u201d are not throwing grenades at the really prosperous and handsome Scandinavians. No, they target NATO countries because in our rapacity we have been bombing and invading countless nations on earth every since I can remember\u2014just to subjugate them and despoil their resources. And when they resist our depredation, we call them \u201cevil.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>No, those misguided Americans who see the USA as a target of an envious horde are not evil: they are just parodying the twaddle that is spread by Western media. Besides, only a hate-scorched mind like Ronald Reagan&#8217;s could conceive of a collection of millions of soviet people as an \u201cevil empire.\u201d George Orwell must be turning in his grave as the USA becomes, to use the title of a 1965 movie, A SHIP OF FOOLS. Communism died because it was unwieldy; now democracy seems set to die of hate and hypocrisy in the hands of those who fancy themselves the new master race\u2014the \u201cexceptional\u201d people.<\/p>\n<p>Lyn Thomas-Ogbuji<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August 03, 2017\u00a0 THE WEST IS NOT EVIL, JUST MISLED Since I discovered Timothy Bancroft-Hinchey a couple of years ago, every word he writes has hit a resonant cord in&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1047"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=1047"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1047\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":1051,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/1047\/revisions\/1051"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=1047"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
