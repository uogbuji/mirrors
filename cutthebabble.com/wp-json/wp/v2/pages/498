It told the story of Len\u2019s character, while also drawing the reader into the history of stage of Len\u2019s life, including the present.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Consistency, clarity and flow of writing<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Each sentenced flowed beautifully into the next and the characters witty banter, descriptive memories, heartfelt emotions, and unlimited knowledge was easy to follow along with. I think that the storyline was very well mapped out, and that there was nothing really left unturned. As a reader, I felt that the author did a great job at not only exploring the present day story of each of the characters, but also their history and how they got to be who and where they are now.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Character Development, including whether they are compelling and believable<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>I feel like all of the characters were compelling and believable, though often found Len not being able to move on from his past to be slightly annoying towards the end of the book. That had to be my only character discrepancy. I would have liked to have seen him move passed his break up with Tarissa and failed marriage sooner, and to see more of his and Speed\u2019s relationship blossom sooner.<br \/>\nI enjoyed each of the differing dynamics between the characters, and the way that Len interacted with each of them as the main character. I felt that the author did a great job portraying what it is really like to balance friendship and colleagueship between those that one also has a working relationship with. I also think that the author does a great job showing some of these relationships grow throughout the book.<br \/>\nLastly, I have to say that though Len annoyed me at times, I really felt invested in him as a reader. Len is a very smart and emotional person that you can\u2019t help but feel like you know him somehow yourself. Though Len can\u2019t seem to get over all that he has lost between his ex-wife and mistress, you can\u2019t help but root for him when you begin to see him take an interest in Speed and see their relationship grow throughout the book.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Any inconsistencies in the plot structure\/story.<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>No inconsistencies that I noticed in the plot structure or story.<\/p>\n<p>I also wanted to just mention that there were thirty-nine words that I actually had to look up their meaning to understand what was being said. This is just something to take into consideration when thinking about the audience and your readers. I consider myself to be well versed and was surprised at the level of language being used. I will say though, that I found these words to fit very well with the level of education of the characters within the story line, so at the same time I don\u2019t know that it is something that I would change either. I personally enjoyed the challenge and got to learn some new words myself, but big words or unknown words might deter a person from finishing the book. This was just a last minute thought.<\/p>\n<p><em>All in all I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the book. I enjoyed the lessons that Len would give to various characters throughout the storyline, I enjoyed the growth that you get to see in each of the characters throughout the storyline, and I just plain enjoyed that storyline itself! Great job!<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Use these DIRECT LINKS to search for my recent Award-Winning novels: PREYING MANTIS &#8211; The Story of Tarissa https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/0692467602\/ HALF PAST TARISSA &#8211; Surviving A Scam https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/1522790853\/ &nbsp; evaluation@bookplex.com EVALUATION\/REVIEW&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/498"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=498"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/498\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":801,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/498\/revisions\/801"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=498"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
