(An example was given as the difficulty of correctly understanding the sentence \u201cWe sell demand-and-supply statistics\u201d (which may make no sense if we remove the two hyphens).<\/p>\n<p>In our health-conscious modern times, the absence of certain undesirable ingredients are used as strong selling points for expensive merchandise or as a \u201cbragging point.\u201d Examples abound:<\/p>\n<p>SMOKE-FREE environment<\/p>\n<p>GLUTEN-FREE menu item<\/p>\n<p>INTEREST-FREE loan; etc.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is a growing tendency to omit the hyphens, and that can change the meaning of the phrase. (If the hyphen must be dropped, then it\u2019s best to plug \u201cfree\u201d onto the preceding word to yield SMOKEFREE, for instance, as German language does.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT\u2019S NEXT?\u00a0<\/strong>\u00a0 Few words of English language seem as clear and simple as the word \u201cnext.\u201d Yet, it is getting bent so far out of shape that it may appear to be ambiguous in some cases. Examples:<\/p>\n<p>A highway sign helpful to pressed motorists says: \u00a0\u00a0 REST STOP 1 MILE,<\/p>\n<p>But just below it is another message:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NEXT REST STOP 62 MILES.<\/p>\n<p>Question: Why is the rest stop that is 1 mile away not the NEXT rest stop? \u201cNext\u201d means the first instance coming up after right now; so the next rest stop is 1 mile away, not 62 miles. (But we understand the messages on that sign to be warning the motorist, \u201cBeware: If you miss the rest stop that is 1 mile away, then the one after it is 62 miles away.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, is there a difference between \u201cThis Friday\u201d and \u201cNext Friday\u201d It depends. If today is Wednesday, then \u201cthis Friday\u201d and \u201cnext Friday\u201d should be referring to the same day, that is only two days away. But if the day is already Friday, then \u201cthis Friday\u201d refers to today, while \u201cnext Friday\u201d refers to the day that is seven days away. We used to say \u201cFriday week\u201d to refer to the Friday AFTER the next one. But these days few people use that expression; instead, people use \u201cnext Friday\u201d when they mean \u201cFriday week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Needless to say, I missed a few meetings because of that needless \u201cnext\u201d ambiguity. (Similarly, when I see a schedule that says a train arrives 12:00 am, I have no idea whether it means 12:00 noon or 12:00 midnight \u2014 as discussed in an earlier blog. In our hurry to make messages brief we may end up making them confusing.)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>THE PARTICLE, <strong>A:\u00a0\u00a0 A<\/strong> is the only one of the 26 letters of our alphabet that can stand alone as a full word in its own right. When it stands alone it functions as a <strong><em>particle<\/em><\/strong>. Wikipedia defines a <strong>particle<\/strong> as \u201ca <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Function_word\">function word<\/a>\u201d that must be associated with another word or phrase to impart meaning. (\u2018The\u2019 is another particle; and \u201can\u201d is an alternative to \u201ca\u201d when the word it refers to begins with a vowel (so we say \u201ca man\u201d but \u201can object\u201d instead of \u201ca object.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Because <strong>A<\/strong> can stand alone, it is sometimes used wrongly in constructions. One sees the following errors, especially in shops and on merchandise:<\/p>\n<p><strong>LAY-A-WAY DEPARTMENT<\/strong> (in which \u2018a\u2019 has been wrongly detached from AWAY and left to serve as a particle;<\/p>\n<p>Children\u2019s <strong>SING-A-LONG SONG<\/strong> (in which \u2018a\u2019 is similarly detached from ALONG).<\/p>\n<p>Such detachment is a corruption induced by poor enunciation in spoken English, which carries over into written English. (We have seen other examples of this corruption in earlier posts on this blog.)<\/p>\n<p>In extreme cases the \u201ca\u201d which is detached from a word is then further separated from that word with the insertion of another word. Thus we get the whopper:<\/p>\n<p><strong>ANOTHER<\/strong> becomes <strong>A NOTHER<\/strong> and then, for emphasis, <strong>A WHOLE NOTHER<\/strong> (such as in the sentence, \u201cThis is a whole nother story.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>September 01, 2016 ORDER OF QUALIFIERS:\u00a0 If I say \u201cHe is a big, strong lad,\u201d \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cstrong\u201d are adjectives qualifying the noun \u201clad.\u201d\u00a0 If I say I saw two&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/690"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=690"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/690\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":691,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/690\/revisions\/691"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=690"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
