And, in contrast to the Judeo-Christian God that will wait till you die and then roast you in a fire for ever and ever, Igbo deities do their protecting and punishing in the here and now\u2014both to cleanse and reform you, and as an object lesson to all.<\/p>\n<p>For justice the Igbos invoke two deities: Ogu and Offor. The former, Ogu (pronounced \u2018Oh-goo\u2019), is a divine instrument to protect the innocent, in other words a shield of defense against false accusation. The latter, Offor, is the instrument of offence or retribution against a perpetrator. Since ogu is a shield, it is neutral, conceptually passive; offor, on the other hand is aggressive and has graduated strength: If you come after me and I\u2019m innocent my offor will always prevail against your ogu and your own offor.<\/p>\n<p>(Note: offor and offo are used here as exactly the same word; it is really spelt \u1ecdf\u1ecd in Igbo.)<\/p>\n<p>So when an Igbo person says \u201cEjim ogu,\u201d or \u201cEjim offor,\u201d he or she is making a potent appeal to the deities to be mindful of who is guilty and who is innocent in a particular dispute. Names like Offodile and Offodike literally warn the adversary that \u201cMy offor is potent: Don\u2019t mess with me.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>Igbos invoke offor more often than ogu, but that\u2019s just a convenience because one implies the other: You can\u2019t hold offor if you don\u2019t have ogu (i.e. if your hands are not clean). Hence the saying: \u201cOji offor ga ana\u201d (one who holds offor \u2014i.e. whose hands are clean\u2014 proceeds safely).<\/p>\n<p>Offor and ogu are not just about religious belief, their concept transcends dogma. In real life if your hands are clean, your conscience is clear and you proceed confidently.
