Global warming is upon us and only the most brazen troglodytes can deny its presence. Its prognosis is grim. Put simply, a lot of the earth\u2019s surface will drown soon and many habitats and species will be gone forever. (And when Vanuatu vanishes, creationist scoffers will chuck it down to divine justice, not to human causes!)<\/p>\n<p>What is global warming and how does it happen? The earth is hotter now than in all recorded history (the dozen millennia during which human civilizations arose); it is set to get warmer, and the accelerating factor is human activity.<\/p>\n<p>Ignoring minute contributions from other stars, all energy on earth comes from the sun. Earth absorbs some of this insolation and reflects the rest back to space. Unfortunately, it is the heat rays (infrared end of the electromagnetic spectrum) that are retained. This is called the greenhouse effect, for it\u2019s the process by which a greenhouse becomes a hothouse in which vegetation flourishes abnormally. On a summer day a car parked on the street will register 20\u201330 degrees higher inside than on the outside if windows are wound up, but not if windows are down\u2014a deadly peril to any children left in a parked car! The reason is that window glass (like our atmosphere) admits all the wavelengths of sunshine but then blocks the heat rays from leaving.<\/p>\n<p>So, atmospheric gases that trap infrared rays and heat up the earth are called \u201cgreenhouse gases.\u201d Some gases are more effective than others at trapping the escaping rays. Water vapor causes 35-70% of our greenhouse effect; carbon dioxide, 10-25%; methane, 4-10%; etc. Fluorinated (hydro)carbons, nitrous oxide (NOX), sulfur compounds are some other potent greenhouse gases. Nature produces greenhouse gases abundantly and they are normally beneficial\u2014but for them, earth\u2019s surface would be too cold for life. But human activity, mostly the energy-allied industry\u2014especially our ubiquitous automobile\u2014is tipping the scales out of balance, threatening to broil us all. And, of course, of all the factors contributing to global warming, human activity is the only one we can control\u2014if the energy industry and their political surrogates let us.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the humongous complexity of interactions that control our climate (Have you heard of the putative \u201cbutterfly effect\u201d of weather change?) a rise of the earth\u2019s mean temperature by a mere couple of degrees might be enough to melt the entire polar ice caps that are tens of miles deep, and cause global flooding. Also, increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, NOX, and sulfur gases, makes ocean water more and more acidic, so that aquatic life begin to die off. (A recent book, \u201cThe Sixth Extinction,\u201d by Elizabeth Kolbert provides a stunning peek at the consequences, and is eminently readable because the author is a journalist and not a scientist. All five extinctions in geologic history arose from natural causes; the sixth and current one, now in progress, is of human making!)<\/p>\n<p>As we know, temperatures vary widely from place to place at any time, and from time to time at any place; so \u201caverage\u201d temperatures are hard to define. That fluctuation provides a dodge for die-hard deniers of global warming who scoff: \u201cWhat global warming? I\u2019m freezing right now!\u201d But when temperatures are plotted against long times, a definite rise in the mean values can be seen by anyone who doesn\u2019t have his head in the sand. That is global warming; it portends climate change! Think of the enormous stakes we\u2019re toying with: humans have nowhere to escape, the earth is all we have!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>August 17, 2017 The predictions of science derive from fact, not conjecture.
