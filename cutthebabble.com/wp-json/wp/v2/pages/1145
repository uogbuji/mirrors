Astonishingly, the main impetus for the gathering storm is the USA, and its chief provocateur is currently Donald Trump. Let us note he did not seize power in a coup or via a putsch. Sober and democratic citizens of the USA put him up there by a big margin. (It\u2019s reminiscent of, and yet strongly different from, Hitler becoming Chancellor of Germany\u2014albeit by the slimmest margin of one vote in the Reichstag!)<\/p>\n<p>Increasingly I hear presumably reasonable Americans dismiss Trump as \u201can aberration,\u201d but I beg to disagree. He is the culmination of Americans&#8217; retrograde romance with reactionary leaders: Nixon, Reagan, Bushes, and an epitome of our xenophobia and supremacist arrogance since \u201cwinning\u201d the Cold War. \u201cTrumpism\u201d is indicative of what we have become, from complacency mingled with a jingoistic view of our own pre-eminence. Those two attributes have attended every powerful empire before it fell. Our return to sanity can only lie in recognizing that we are NOT \u201ca special people,\u201d an \u201cexceptional nation,\u201d \u201cleaders of the world,\u201d or any such twaddle. We must refocus our self-view. We are just another country with a large potential for good in the world, and with the same rights to life and liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u2014no more than other people of other nations and countries. If we insist on dominating the whole world, we shall soon capsize it.<\/p>\n<p>Two World Wars were inflicted on humanity because one people, Germans\u2014with their kinfolk of Austro-Hungary\u2014thought themselves too powerful to brook opposition in any dispute, even on matters so minute as a certain bullet fired in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914. If a third WW is fought it will probably be because we Americans have developed a similarly grotesque view of our magisterial importance in the world of today. \u201cThose whom the gods will destroy, they first make mad.\u201d And when the blow-back from Trump\u2019s Jerusalem gambit commences, as it surely will, most Americans will scramble to fall in line and \u201csupport our president in a time of crisis,\u201d as always. That&#8217;s how we enable the endless acts of predatory aggression by our government. But of course we then try to delude ourselves with the tongue-in-cheek disclaimer that &#8220;We&#8217;re not responsible for the actions of our government.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&#8220;The lamps are going out all over Europe (and) we shall not see them lit again in our life-time,&#8221; the British Foreign Secretary lamented on the eve of WW-1.
