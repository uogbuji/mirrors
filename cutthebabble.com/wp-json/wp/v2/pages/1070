I find that applies as much to the processes of daily life: people are thinking less and less and instead believing more and more: not just religious doctrines but political propaganda too.<\/p>\n<p>After Boko Haram had been terrorizing Nigeria and its adjoining countries for over five years, I found out that the average university-educated Nigerian had no idea what the phrase \u201cboko haram\u201d meant. Instead of finding out, they just parroted whatever Western media told them it meant. The first time I heard a Nigerian with a doctorate degree announce to a gathering that the meaning of Boko Haram was \u201cWestern Education is forbidden,\u201d I let it ride. The second time, it came from a lady whose intellect I held in very high esteem; but because she was known to have a rather bad case of \u201cWest-o-philia,\u201d I took her on.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoko Haram\u201d is a phrase made up of just two words: \u201cbook\u201d and \u201charam,\u201d I pointed out. Now, I asked her, which of those two words referred to \u201cwestern?\u201d She made no answer, so I explained:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBoko\u201d is a Hausa corruption of \u201cbook.\u201d It is another version of \u201cbookuru,\u201d the derogatory word that Hausas used to sneer at bookish learning. And \u201charam\u201d is borrowed from the Arabic word \u201charaam\u201d (which means an abomination). So, which of those two words implied \u201cwestern\u201d?\u00a0 The lady replied lamely that it was what the media said.<\/p>\n<p>Our unquestioning acceptance of whatever issues from Western \u201cauthority\u201d is one reason why falsehood and propaganda are swamping us in the guise of \u201cnews.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One thinking person in that gathering wondered out aloud why the media injected \u201cwestern\u201d in their interpretation of \u201cboko haraam.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Easy, I said. Western society likes to position itself as a special target of Islam, in part because that gives the USA and NATO excuse to keep up pressure on Islam. Boko Haram thugs are misguided (albeit no more so than Christian fanatics) but they are indiscriminate anarchists rather than haters of West, or any other cardinal point.<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, although Hausa is a bit more advanced than other Nigerian languages in sophistication, it remains the essentially oral language of a simple people, just like Igbo (my native language) and Yoruba, etc. Most African languages developed in an unwritten form (until European colonists brought their script and alphabets). Languages that develop solely from oral traditions have to be simple and their vocabularies compact\u2014because you can only carry so much in your head.<\/p>\n<p>For that reason many African languages lack words for those things that are strictly abstract, such as the cardinal points (east, west, north, and south). I\u2019ve forgotten most of the Hausa I learned in boyhood, but I doubt that it has a word for \u201cwestern\u201d any more than other African languages. (For \u201cwest,\u201d Igbo uses the phrase \u201cthe place where the sun sets.\u201d) Even the geopolitical term \u201cNorth,\u201d introduced by the British to describe Hausaland in relationship to the rest of Nigeria, is inadequately rendered by Igbo as \u201cUgwu Awusa,\u201d which means \u201cUphill in Hausaland.\u201d It takes a little thought to realize that this is a poor translation since Northern Nigeria is not really at higher elevation than the Southern regions. Northern Nigerians refer to their region as &#8220;Arewa&#8221; but I suspect it connotes their collective ethnic heritage rather than geographic direction.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, the Igbo expression for \u201cheaven\u201d (another pure abstraction) is \u201celu-igwe\u201d or, literally, \u201cthe top of the sky! For hell it is \u201coku-mmuo\u201d or the devil\u2019s fire (which is closer in concept). While the two concept, heaven and hell, have definite denotations in christian mythology, their connotation is totally abstract.<\/p>\n<p>Everything emanating from Western media these days must be taken \u201ccum grano salis\u201d (to use the Latin caveat, \u201cwith a grain of salt\u201d). Most Westerners insist to me that Russia (or, North Korea these days) is a terrible threat to the West, to the world\u2014until I ask them to name on country that Russia (or Korea) has invaded since the USSR fell in 1986. They think a bit, then smile sheepishly as I point out that the USA and NATO have invaded and scattered eleven countries since 1986, murdering several leaders of those countries.<\/p>\n<p>Or take those who insist that \u201cTerrorists hate and envy us because we are the richest and most advanced nation.\u201d I point out that the Scandinavian countries have a higher standard of living and a better quality of life than the USA. Why do the \u201cterrorists leave them alone and target the USA? Most Americans close their eyes to the fact that the bloody and rapacious rampage of the US &amp; NATO (with 25 million Middle easterners expelled as refugees from their homes since \u201c9\/11\u201d) is more than enough to ignite a furious backlash.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>WHAT USE IS A BRAIN IF YOU WON&#8217;T USE IT?
