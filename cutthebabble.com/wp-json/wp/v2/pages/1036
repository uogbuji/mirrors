The brazen fraud which he has so masterfully stripped naked is absolutely on par with Smith Woodward\u2019s 1912 saga of the <em>Piltdown Ape-Man<\/em>, and William Summerlin&#8217;s hand-painted spots (1974) given as evidence for a genetically altered mouse.<\/p>\n<p>NazarethGate is exceedingly well researched, as it had to be since it takes on the conspiracy of an entrenched clique of camouflaged pseudo-scholars going back centuries.<\/p>\n<p><em>It may be too soon to ask, but is there yet a rejoinder from those sorry \u201cNazareth\u201d hoax-forgers? <\/em><\/p>\n<p>We may never shake the infinite gullibility of hysterical Jesus-Christ believers: witness the persistent veneration of <em>The Shroud of Turin<\/em> or a recent \u201cmiracle\u201d cited by the Pope for canonizing <em>Mother Teresa:<\/em> The adequate exposure obtained in photographing her at a somewhat reduced light level is claimed by the Church to reflect a celestial miracle illuminating her piety. And that crap, in spite of the photographer\u2019s testimony that he had boosted the photo-shoot with the latest ultra-fast film from Kodak!<\/p>\n<p>Nevertheless, our true academic archaeologists should not put up with scandalous forgeries such as were unmasked in <u>NazarethGate<\/u>; the ball is in their court.
