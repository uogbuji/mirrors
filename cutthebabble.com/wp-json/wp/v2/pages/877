A US celebrity said recently two coming soccer events in Russia (2017 FIFA Confederation Cup and 2018 FIFA World Cup) \u201c\u2026are also major contests for hearts and minds: occasions for Russia to impress the world \u2014 because all through my life we\u2019ve been taught to fear and dislike \u2018Big, Bad Russia\u2019.\u201d One is reminded of Sarah Palin\u2019s 2007 VP candidates\u2019 debate.<\/p>\n<p>Moderator: <em>\u201cDescribe your foreign policy objectives.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sarah Palin: <em>\u201cI can see Russia from my window.\u201d<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But as our leaders rage against Russia, I prefer to listen to history: it misleads none but those who seek to rewrite it. Since the USSR fell (1989) the USA has invaded or devastated eleven countries with \u201cshock-and-awe\u201d blitz, while Russia has invaded none, not one. But it would be madness be to provoke a war with Russia. As we swagger from one confrontation to another, we\u2019d do well to give the Russians a wide berth: to let sleeping dogs lie.<\/p>\n<p>Russia\u2019s new pacifism doesn\u2019t make them saints, or cowards. They are just recoiling from the horrors of being repeatedly overrun by invaders, something the USA has never faced. A Pravda columnist put it this way: <em>\u201cRussia destroyed the army of Napoleon\u2026 when he invaded Russia in 1812; then 130 years later \u2026\u00a0 Hitler, when he invaded Russia. That victory was won at the horrific sacrifice of over 26 million Russians killed, or starved to death, and the destruction of thousands of their cities; which is why Russia does not want to fight another war ever again\u2026.\u201d<\/em> President Eisenhower showed similarly mature restraint in 1956 when he stared down Britain, France, and Israel as they invaded Egypt over the Suez Crisis. A just warrior knows when not to rattle the saber.<\/p>\n<p>Now we are spoiling for a fight with Russia. Hollywood\u2019s patriotic fiction, \u201cThe Longest Day,\u201d misled us into thinking the USA won WW-II. True, the USA won the Pacific war almost unaided, but it was really the USSR that destroyed the Nazi Werhrmact.<\/p>\n<p>Three poignant facts from WW-II history underscore that point:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Google \u201cUSSR\u201d and you\u2019ll see a nearly horizon-to-horizon sweep of red, showing lands liberated by Marshals Zhukov and Rokossowski: It is over 200 times the area liberated by Eisenhower\u2019s forces (Italy, France-Belgium-West Germany).<\/li>\n<li>Those battles of the Russian Front were the largest in history, and \u201ccharacterized by unprecedented ferocity\u201d (<em>Wikipedia<\/em>).<\/li>\n<li>Historians estimate that of every ten men killed in the European WW-II Theater, nine died on the Russian Front.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>So, if we are spoiling for a fight with Russia, a gratuitous war at that, we should first ask the French and the Germans how indomitable the Russians can be as adversaries.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s another bit of Russian wisdom we are yet to acquire (Russia being five times as old as the USA). From the dark centuries of Tsarism, followed by Stalin\u2019s terror, they learned know how easily the hard-won freedoms of a people can be chipped away in times of national crises, as leaders cry \u201cWolf!\u201d incessantly and demonize imagined enemies day and night. Riveting the people\u2019s attention on national enemies is the career politicians\u2019 most effective ploy to paralyze a people\u2019s will and render them willing \u2014even eager\u2014 to give up their personal freedoms at the behest of a \u201cwise\u201d leader.<\/p>\n<p>The USA is arguably the most affluent country in history and, until recently, one with a most appealing portfolio of ideas regarding human progress; and we are a continental superpower embracing 4 time zones across the North American continent. But Russia has made its own contributions to world history, and is a supra-continental superpower, spanning eleven time zones across two continents: Europe and Asia. For us to keep demonizing Russia long after communism ended (\u201cPutin\u2019s the new Hitler\u201d) is beyond quixotic: it\u2019s idiotic. There\u2019s room enough on earth for all of us.<\/p>\n<p>Compared to Russian, the USA is a pubescent nation and, like a teenager, suffused with in-your-face hormones. A teenager who won\u2019t learn to control those hormones runs the risk of foreclosing on adulthood. Lessons from major wars are loaded with heartbreak. And the tragedy of that heartbreak is that its consequences are visited more heavily on our progeny than on us, the provocateurs.<\/p>\n<p>It is time to re-think our priorities once again, to transcend a greed for material dominance. Hopefully, we are the same USA whose foreign policy was once graced by the magnanimity of the Marshall Plan and the Berlin Airlift. Must we conquer a people before we can befriend them?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>June 12, 2017 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Two generations after the Baby Boomers, Americans are still urged&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/877"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=877"}],"version-history":[{"count":5,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/877\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":883,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/877\/revisions\/883"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=877"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
