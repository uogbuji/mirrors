What you can expect to see at this site are the issues and snafus that attend communication between people in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>This blog is a commentary on those peculiarities of the American usage of the English language, reflecting a highly popular tendency to blaze one\u2019s own trail, right or wrong. Americans call their most popular game \u201c<em>football,<\/em>\u201d when it is almost never played with the foot (and with utter disregard for the billions of people the world over who play their football with the <strong>foot<\/strong>). They ride to the moon and beyond in spacecraft that still measure quantities in \u201c<em>bushels,<\/em>\u201d \u201c<em>inche<\/em>s,\u201d and \u201c<em>pounds<\/em>,\u201d with implicit disdain for the rest of humanity who have coalesced completely around metric mensuration for generations now. But most notable Americanisms occur in communication: such as the blustery assertion, \u201c<em>I don\u2019t want no nothin\u2019 from nobody<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>During my third year in the USA, a colleague in grad school said something that gave me pause. He had asked what time of year I first arrived in the USA. To show off my two-year acculturation into US English I replied, \u201cFer-byu-wary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The colleague smiled ruefully and said: \u201cMost of you Africans come here speaking proper English, but then you slide into the casual American way of saying things.\u201d I smiled, and corrected myself, \u201cFe-bru-ary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He was right, of course. But the urge to conform to Americanisms is very strong among immigrants. As the saying goes, \u201cYou have to go along in order to get along.\u201d So, before long some of us from Anglophone West Africa begin to babble in the American way. We learn to make popular mistakes like the following (the underlined words are redundant or incorrect):<\/p>\n<p>\u201cShe <u>brung<\/u> lunch.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe <u>drug <\/u>the couch across the room.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGet off <u>of<\/u> me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He visited my wife and I&#8221; (should be &#8220;my wife and me&#8221; both pronouns in the accusative case).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s not that tall <u>of<\/u> a man.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhere\u2019s he <u>at<\/u>?\u201d (\u201cWhere\u201d means \u201cat what place\u201d; thus, repeating \u201cat\u201d amounts to tautology.)<\/p>\n<p>Does all this matter? Well, that depends. It may not be that big a deal (Americans would say \u201cthat big of a deal\u201d) when we are engaged in vocal conversation. But in written communication misunderstanding can easily arise from using wrong words or phrases.<\/p>\n<p>Verbal conversation, after all, is often clarified by being augmented with other, non-verbal cues\u2014body language gestures like nods and smiles\u2014especially when one is addressing peers who share his vernacular.<\/p>\n<p>A mother who admonishes her son, \u201cDon\u2019t tell no lies to nobody!\u201d is not likely to be misunderstood. But when you communicate in writing, your audience has nothing but your exact words to tell them what you mean. That is why the rules of grammar and syntax are in place for \u201cformal\u201d (i.e. written) English. That is the area that concerns us in this blog.<\/p>\n<p>The American gusto for improvisation fosters innovation, yes; but also quite often it leaves you scratching your head. Please come in! You can scratch my head and I will scratch yours, OK?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>MIND YOUR LANGUAGE! This is a new site, full of hope and trepidation!
