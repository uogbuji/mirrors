We eat too much (food being so cheap and plentiful here); but we prefer to blame obesity and related maladies on eating the \u201cwrong stuff.\u201d Trouble is, everyone has an opinion regarding what\u2019s \u201cright\u201d to eat. National Geographic June 2017 featured a new book, \u201cPandora\u2019s Lab\u201d by Paul Offat, which bears a lesson: The benefit of a scientific discovery is ambiguous; complications only become clear after prolonged gestation and refinement through peer review. It\u2019s really true that a little learning is a dangerous thing; or, as Greek Classics puts it, Drink the Pierian Spring deeply, or not at all!<\/p>\n<p>\u201cPandora\u2019s Lab\u201d highlights some of the dietary fads that have misled Americans for decades now: fats, margarine versus butter, cholesterol, antioxidants\u2026 the whole mumbo-jumbo gamut that is often based on incomplete inquiry, on mere whims and preferences, or at best on one-off findings that are rushed from laboratory to the media without benefit of thorough follow-up studies and controlled clinical trials. (And, oh, how egregiously the claim \u201cclinically proven\u201d is abused these days!) The book laments that US government\u2019s endorsement of mere speculations regarding \u201cheart-healthy food\u201d did much mortal harm to the health of Americans.<\/p>\n<p>One wishes the review had included \u201cGMO,\u201d \u201cOrganic,\u201d &amp; \u201cGluten-Free\u201d labels: the glamorous new fads that peddle expensive abracadabra of doubtful benefit. \u201cOrganic\u201d is an absurd prefix for food since its opposite is \u201cinorganic,\u201d and there are no inorganic foods. (No one eats mineral rocks!) Its unscientific pretension is like calling yourself \u201cpro-life\u201d to cast your opponents as \u201cpro-death\u201d by contrast. I will heed the \u201cGMO\u201d gripes and \u201corganic\u201d produce only when mainstream scientists demonstrate their merits. Advocacies often originate in someone\u2019s prejudice; the strident ones tend to quote those scientific studies supporting their position, and ignore or dispute the contrary ones. Sound &amp; lasting scientific consensus on food and health issues take long decades to concretize. Short-cuts are hazardous. When in doubt, I do not jump on any faddish bandwagon: I ask my doctor.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Weight-watching is a hot topic in the USA.
