It invokes the \u201cgreat wisdom\u201d of the Ancient Chinese who, it says, pioneered the habit. I\u2019ve seen it thrice in a dozen years, most recently from a \u201cDoctor of Medicine,\u201d no less! The article explains that a hot beverage flushes toxic waste and getters fatty impurities from your blood stream \u2014 which cold drinks cannot do. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Garamond;\">Therein lies an absurdity. The first time I saw that message, it was forwarded to me by a colleague. I reminded him of the first lessons of biology that we learned in high school: metabolism maintains the body temperature of all mammals at a constant value, which, for humans, is ~37<sup>o<\/sup>C (~98<sup>o<\/sup>F). No matter how hot or cold the morsel you swallow, it will rapidly adjust to your body temperature as it goes down your gullet to your stomach, is digested, and finally absorbed into your blood stream &#8212; unless, of course, you&#8217;re already a cadaver (in which case) you can&#8217;t swallow anything, hot or cold. So, nothing you eat or drink will raise or lower your core body temperature, much less getter impurities from your blood. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>June 19, 2017 My last post about circulation of snake venom in the human body (yikes!) reminded me of a certain chain-mail twaddle that goes around these days: about the&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/931"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=931"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/931\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":933,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/931\/revisions\/933"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=931"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
