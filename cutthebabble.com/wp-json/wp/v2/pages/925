For adjectives this is done by adding the suffixes <em>\u2013er<\/em> (for the comparative) or <em>\u2013est<\/em> (for the superlative) form of the adjective.<\/p>\n<p>Thus: cute, <em>cuter<\/em>, <em>cutest<\/em>; big, <em>bigger<\/em>, <em>biggest<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>For adverbs it is done by prefixing <em>more<\/em> (comparative) and <em>most<\/em> (superlative).<\/p>\n<p>Some adjectives are compared in two ways:\u00a0 (1) with the suffixes \u2013<em>er <\/em>and &#8211;<em>est<\/em>, or (2) with the prefixes <em>more<\/em> and <em>most<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>Thus: either (1) likely, <em>likelier<\/em>, and <em>likeliest<\/em>; or (2) likely, <em>more likely<\/em>, and <em>most likely<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>(\u201cLikely\u201d is an adjective in British English; in US English it has become an adverb as well.)<\/p>\n<p>The adjective \u201cfar\u201d is a prominent exception that is often terribly confused in US literature. \u00a0Depending on its exact context (i.e. the meaning it conveys, it is compared in two different ways: (far \u2013 <em>farther<\/em> &#8211; <em>farthest<\/em>, or far \u2013 <em>further <\/em>&#8211; <em>furthest<\/em>)).<\/p>\n<p>When \u201cfar\u201d connotes physical distance, we use <em>farther<\/em> &amp; <em>farthest<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>But if the connotation is degree\/extent (not physical distance), we use <em>further<\/em> &amp; <em>furthest<\/em>.\u00a0 Thus:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A bicycle travels far, an automobile travels farther, and an airplane travels farthest.<\/li>\n<li>Mom stopped at 6<sup>th<\/sup> Grade; Dad went further, to high school; I went furthest, to college.<\/li>\n<li>Beauty takes you far, money takes you further, but knowledge takes you furthest.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><u>Contrasting Quantities<\/u><\/p>\n<p>These days all supermarkets try to make checking out smoother by designating faster lanes for the lightest shoppers. Thus you see lanes with the labels TEN ITEMS OR LESS, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>That is wrong; it should be TEN ITEMS OR FEWER. Why?<\/p>\n<p>For things you cannot count: water, flour, vegetables, etc., it is \u201cless\u201d (not \u201cfewer\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>For quantities you can count: items, books, tomatoes, etc., it is \u201cfewer\u201d (not \u201cless\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>What can you count? That\u2019s intuitive; but as a rule, if you cannot subdivide the quantity into individual, discrete pieces, then you can\u2019t count it. Thus, if you say \u201ctwo liters of water\u201d or \u201cthree pounds of flour\u201d it is the liters or pounds you are counting (not the water or flour):<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ambiguous Cases:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuy ten or fewer liters of water\u201d is correct if the \u201cfewer\u201d refers to liters (not water).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuy ten liters of water or less\u201d is correct also, if the \u201cless\u201d refers to water (not liters).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBuy ten oranges or less\u201d is wrong because oranges can be counted; it should be \u201cfewer.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Monday, June 26, 2017 Comparing Adjectives\/Adverbs We are constantly comparing and contrasting quantities: you are poor, I am poorer; he is smart, she is smarter; they are tall, we are&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/925"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=925"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/925\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":927,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/925\/revisions\/927"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=925"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
