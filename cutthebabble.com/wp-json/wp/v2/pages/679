It is the use of a word (or its homophone) in such a manner as to convey an idea different from, even opposite to, its meaning at face value. For instance, in the classic novel about <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<\/em>, the determined investigator says of his elusive quarry, Mr. Hyde: \u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde, then I\u2019ll be Mr. Seek.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One particularly sharp pun was attributed to Ferdinand Marcos, the once dictator of The Philippines, in an interview he gave to <em>Playboy<\/em> magazine in the presence of his wife Imelda, shortly before he died. Mr. Marcos had once trained in law and liked to consider himself a lawyer still. The interviewer asked Mr. Marcos what epitaph he would like on his tombstone.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Reflecting for a while, Mr. Marcos answered, \u201cHere lies a lawyer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">His wife pursed her lips and said, \u201cNo. \u2018Here lies a lawyer who lies no more\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: right;\">Mr. Marcos caught the mood and said, \u201cNo. \u2018Here lies a lawyer who lies still\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><u>Note: <\/u><\/p>\n<p>The quotes may have been a knock-off (by Playboy or by Mr. Marcos) from an apocryphal lawyer joke, but the pun is neat.<\/p>\n<p>In Mr. Marcos\u2019 first choice, \u201clies\u201d is unambiguous.<\/p>\n<p>In the second (Imelda\u2019s version) the pun is on \u201clies\u201d (used in two different senses).<\/p>\n<p>In the third version the pun is on both \u201clies\u201d and \u201cstill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; THE PUN (Topic for August 2016) Like a malapropism, a pun is a play on words, but of&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/679"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=679"}],"version-history":[{"count":1,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/679\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":680,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/679\/revisions\/680"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=679"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
