Nwosu)<\/p>\n<p>I enjoyed this piece about one of Igbo people\u2019s traditional marital practices. We note that the story is not fictional or apocryphal but real: attributable to a definite time and place known to us.<\/p>\n<p>I have taken the liberty of reproducing it (with full attribution, of course) on the IGBO CUSTOMS forum at my website (see link below). It complements my related article there on the ancient Igbo practice of keeping concubines (for both wives and husbands) \u2014as a safety valve to ensure that nobody\u2019s libido is left dangerously without relief!<\/p>\n<p>As for \u201cpolygamy,\u201d I have suggested in two of my books that Africans or Muslims should not be embarrassed by the practice of marrying many wives, <strong><em>if that is what their societies prescribe<\/em><\/strong> (and as long as no one is offended by it). Until recent years, I admit, I too had bought wholesale into the Western hypocrisy of praising whatever Westerners do and condemning all non-Western practices. Unfortunately, in giving us practical education that fitted us for participation in modern economies, Christian missionaries also taught us to despise and condemn the ways of our forbears. For instance, Western beliefs &amp; cosmologies are called \u201creligion\u201d and ours are called \u201csuperstition\u201d; their deities are \u201cgods\u201d while ours are \u201cfetishes\u201d and \u201cidols\u201d!<\/p>\n<p>Consider the etymology of \u201cpolygamy.\u201d It comes from only two Greek words: POLY = \u201cmany\u201d and GAMOS = \u201cspouse.\u201d (See below for the etymological definition from a scholarly source.)<\/p>\n<p>By that stark and simple definition, most adults in the Americas and Europe TODAY are clearly polygamists: they have had a succession of spouses.<\/p>\n<p>What the West did to hoodwink us was redefine polygamy as \u201cmarrying more than one wife at the same time.\u201d By adding the phrase \u201cat the same time,\u201d they excluded and excused their sequential polygamy and condemned our simultaneous polygamy. Clever!!!\u00a0 But I liken that to the difference between serial\/sequential murder and mass\/simultaneous murder!<\/p>\n<p>Anyone who has read George Orwell\u2019s satire, \u201cAnimal Farm,\u201d will immediately recognize the clever ploy of perverting a principle by adding qualifiers. When the pigs decided to claim preeminence in the new Animal Republic, they altered the main Principle of Animalism: whereas it had declared, \u201cAll Animals are Equal,\u201d the pigs added a new clause: \u201c\u2014but some are more equal than others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s the way of the West: Whatever they do is kosher; what we do is barbaric! American leaders have carried that to absurd heights by openly claiming \u201cExceptionalism,\u201d by which they mean that the USA is so special that general rules do not apply to it. I now routinely see through such ruses.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj22vSg8-_UAhWh3YMKHd-qD7UQFghIMAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wyzant.com%2Fresources%2Flessons%2Fenglish%2Fetymology%2Fwords-mod-polygamy&amp;usg=AFQjCNH-CNNHtp9irGZ5YUhao0wTwhK6uw\">Polygamy, Polyandry, and Polygyny | Wyzant Resources<\/a><\/h3>\n<p>https:\/\/www.wyzant.com \u203a Resources \u203a Lessons \u203a English \u203a Etymology<\/p>\n<p><em>Etymology<\/em> of <em>polygamy<\/em>.
