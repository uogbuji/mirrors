A scientific theory must have been:<\/p>\n<p>proposed as conjecture, tested and proved as hypothesis, and used by a myriad scientists to explain all relevant observations made to date (especially, those that defied explanation by any other means); it has led to new predictions which have been tested and confirmed; and it has never failed any test known to man.<\/p>\n<p>Next time a creationist says \u201cEvolution is just a theory,\u201d tell him what the poet Alexander Pope said: &#8220;A little learning is a dangerous thing \/ Drink deep, or taste not the Pierian Spring.&#8221; (Or, just roll your eyes: a creationist is probably too daft to tell Alexander Pope from Pope Alexander!)<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We think of Einstein\u2019s theory of relativity as an exceptionally incisive scientific idea.
