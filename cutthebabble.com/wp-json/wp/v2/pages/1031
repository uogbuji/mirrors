Here is an example (others appear elsewhere on this \u201cAn Atheist Home Page\u201d forum).<\/p>\n<p>I did a little calculation to see how much water Noah\u2019s god needed to flood the earth to the top of Mount Ararat. (The calculation is so easy that any Noah of today could perform it. All he\u2019d need are: the formula for the volume of a spherical shell, the radius of the earth, and the height of Mt. Ararat. Here\u2019s my back-of-the-envelope shot at it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Result:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Water volume to cover Earth to the top of Ararat is <strong><em>V<\/em><\/strong> = (4\/3).(\u043f).(<strong><em>R<\/em><\/strong><sup>3<\/sup>&#8211;<strong><em>r<\/em><\/strong><sup>3<\/sup>)<\/p>\n<p>Where <strong><em>r<\/em><\/strong> is earth\u2019s radius from its core up to sea level, and R is earth\u2019s radius up to top of Ararat. (If <strong><em>h<\/em><\/strong> is the height of Ararat above sea level, <strong><em>R<\/em><\/strong>= <strong><em>r<\/em><\/strong> + <strong><em>h<\/em><\/strong>.)<\/p>\n<p>From Wikipedia: <strong><em>r<\/em><\/strong> = 6,371\u00a0km, and <strong><em>h<\/em><\/strong> = 5.137 km (So, <strong><em>R<\/em><\/strong> = 6376.137 km)<\/p>\n<p>Thus <strong><em>V<\/em><\/strong> = \u00a0\u00a01,085,831,769,358 km<sup>3<\/sup> (1.086 x10<sup>12<\/sup> cubic kilometers)<\/p>\n<p>But the total water on earth now is 1,386,000,000 km<sup>3<\/sup> 1.39&#215;10<sup>9<\/sup> km<sup>3<\/sup> (Wikipedia)<\/p>\n<p>So, Noah\u2019s flood required 783 times the total water on earth \u2014 not twice, not ten times, nor even a hundred times, but nearly a thousand times. In other words, the earth contains less than one-tenth of one percent of the water needed to flood the world up to the top of Mount Ararat.<\/p>\n<p>(<em><strong>Analogy:<\/strong><\/em> If Noah\u2019s flood required one bucket of water to drown all earth, the earth has only one tea-spoonful!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 1:<\/strong> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Did the rest come from outside the earth?<\/p>\n<p>(Wikipedia says our atmosphere holds only 0.001% of the earth\u2019s water!)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Question 2:<\/strong>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Where did all the extra water go after the flood?<\/p>\n<p>[When I emailed &#8220;Answers in Genesis&#8221; to ask this question in 2017, they shot back that \u201cALL THAT WATER IS STILL HERE ON EARTH\u201d!!!]<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>BTW<\/em><\/strong>: Why did Genesis bring Noah\u2019s ark down to rest on Mount Ararat? Clearly, geography was severely limited for the stone-age men who wrote the bible. If they had known of and used Mt.
