A $1000.00 water bill would be considered \u201celectric,\u201d even if you are Bill Gates. The bill that comes from your power utility is your electricity bill; it is not electric if it is for $1.50.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Athletic or Athletics?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe man that controls and regulates sports in your high school: Is he your \u201cAthletic Director\u201d or your \u201cAthletics Director\u201d? It depends. If he is muscle-bound and presses 100 lbs., he may qualify to be called \u201cathletic\u201d (which means the same as \u201csportive\u201d); but if he is a 250-lb couch potato that oversees sporting activities from the cushy comfort of an air-conditioned office, the best he can be is an Athletics Director. A school may have a physics or mathematics or athletics teacher (in each case a noun). Those nouns are always used in the plural, never in the singular, so that a \u201cphysic\u201d or \u201cmathematic\u201d or \u201cathletic\u201d teacher makes no sense.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you \u201csix foot tall\u201d or \u201csix feet tall\u201d?<\/strong><br \/>\nThe foot in \u201csix-foot man\u201d is really an adjective. It is called an adjectival noun because, while it is a noun, it functions as an adjective in that construction (qualifying man). It is like saying someone is a house painter: \u201chouse\u201d is an adjectival noun here, qualifying painter.<\/p>\n<p>So, \u201cI am six foot tall\u201d makes no sense really: it uses an adjective (foot) where it should use a plural noun (feet). A six-foot man is six feet (plural noun) tall; a woman who measures five feet and six inches in height is a \u201cfive-foot-and-six-inch woman\u201d; and a child that weighs fifty pounds is a fifty-pound child. Similarly, a twenty-dollar lunch costs twenty dollars (plural noun). We seem to get confused only when it comes to height! Nobody can be \u201c6 (or 5, etc.) foot tall,\u201d Such a unit of height does not exist. If your height is six feet, then: You are a six footer, a six foot person, or a person six feet tall. Just keep in mind \u201cnoun versus adjective\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t get it wrong.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Transitive &amp; Intransitive Verbs<\/strong><br \/>\nDo you Lie down or Lay down? It depends on what is lying or being laid. Americans seem to tip-toe around the verb to lay because of its sexually loaded nuance. But as children we learned the Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John prayer: \u201c\u2026Before I lay me down to sleep \/ I give my soul to Christ to keep\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, LIE is an intransitive verb: Present Tense, \u201cI lie down,\u201d and Past Tense, \u201cI lay down\u201d \u2015 but LAY is a transitive verb because it takes an object. Thus, a child who is ready to sleep will first lay her book down and then lie down (or lay herself down).<\/p>\n<p>So, \u201cI will lay down on the couch\u201d is confusing, unless you are a hen laying eggs.<br \/>\n<strong>Prepositions<\/strong><br \/>\nSome prepositions are used exclusively or preferentially with some verbs in certain contexts. Thus you \u201cwait for\u201d somebody (if you are biding time for that somebody to be ready to do something); but you \u201cwait on\u201d somebody if you are a waiter in a restaurant or an attendant in a shop, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen the case of \u201coff\u201d and \u201con\u201d in a previous post at this blog site. Each is a complete preposition: \u201cI put the book on the table,\u201d or \u201cI won $5 off him in a bet.\u201d In this context \u201coff-of\u201d is meaningless (as in \u201cTake your hands off-of me\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>12\/06\/15 Topic for December, 2015, PARTS OF SPEECH (REVISITED) CONFUSION OVER PARTS OF SPEECH Everybody knows the difference between nouns and adjectives, right?
