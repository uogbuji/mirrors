But then, at an animated campus round-table, I heard a feisty woman describe her field of study as \u201cherstory.\u201d Only the knowing smirks around the table revealed to me what she meant. Sure: If \u201chistory\u201d is OK, why not \u201cherstory\u201d (or, really, \u201chertory\u201d). Academic disciplines should give equal billing to women. Right? Well&#8230;.<\/p>\n<p>In my father\u2019s time it was perfectly fine to say: \u201cEveryone should speak his mind\u201d and not worry that females were being excluded from speaking their minds. In my own time we hedged our bets and said, \u201cEveryone should speak his or her mind.\u201d Clumsy, yes, but it kept the feminists mollified. Later, the need for brevity AND gender-neutrality led to the ungrammatical but irresistibly succinct, \u201cEveryone should speak their mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The use of the masculine pronoun to represent the human race has been in retreat ever since. Some now even claim that God is a woman. Why not? When referring to the deity why don&#8217;t we stop using the pronoun &#8220;he&#8221; and replace with &#8220;it&#8221;?<\/p>\n<p>And so we are now at a point where anything is possible. Recently a lady on television was introduced as an \u201combudswoman\u201d for Medicaid patients. OMBUDSMAN is not an English word; it comes from Swedish, and the \u201cman\u201d at the end of it does not really mean \u201cmale person.\u201d One must wonder whether Swedes would approve of this overly creative adaptation of their word for a designated arbiter between government and citizen. Unfortunately, that silly coinage is enabled by no less an \u201cauthority\u201d than the Yahoo Dictionary (dictionary.search.yahoo.com ), which, in this day and age, defines ombudsman as \u201ca man who\u2026.\u201d (Yahoo could simply have said \u201cperson\u201d instead of \u201cman.\u201d)<\/p>\n<p>If the trend continues we may end up calling Angela Merkel a \u201cGerwoman\u201d instead of a German; and we may come to have both manpower and \u201cwomanpower\u201d in the American workforce, all under the leadership of managers and \u201cwomanagers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Who is responsible for the coinage of new English words, anyway?<\/p>\n<p>Come on, guys (and girls?): Do you have an instance of feminist nomenclature gone too far, or not far enough?
