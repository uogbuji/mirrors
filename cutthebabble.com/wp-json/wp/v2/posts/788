But some kinds of noun are not simple, and forming their plurals is not always straight-forward. Commonest among these are the compound nouns, which are comprised of two or more words: e.g., two nouns, or a noun and a qualifying word (an adjective, for instance), or a noun and a phrase. In such cases the compound noun is easily seen as a substantive noun, plus the qualifying word or words. To form the plural in such cases, an \u201cs\u201d is added to the substantive noun, not to the qualifiers.
