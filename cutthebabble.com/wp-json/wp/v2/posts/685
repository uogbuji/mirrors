It is the use of a word (or its homophone) in such a manner as to convey an idea different from, even opposite to, its meaning at face value. For instance, in the classic novel about <em>Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde<\/em>, the determined investigator says of his elusive quarry, Mr. Hyde: \u201cIf he be Mr. Hyde, then I\u2019ll be Mr. Seek.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For another example, a promotional poster for Jamaica\u2019s ultrafast sprinter Usain Bolt says, \u201cWalk, Run, Bolt!\u201d The use of \u201cBolt\u201d as a verb is eloquent. And in the 1970s an advertisement for \u201cMother\u2019s Pride,\u201d a popular brand of breakfast bread, said \u201cReturn your MP to the kitchen cabinet.\u201d (All four nouns and verbs here are puns, and each pun relates to England\u2019s parliamentary election process.)<\/p>\n<p>One particularly sharp pun was attributed to Ferdinand Marcos, the once dictator of The Philippines, in an interview he gave to <em>Playboy<\/em> magazine in the presence of his wife Imelda, shortly before he died. Mr. Marcos had once trained in law and liked to consider himself a lawyer still. The interviewer asked Mr. Marcos what epitaph he would like on his tombstone.<\/p>\n<p>Reflecting for a while, Mr. Marcos answered, \u201cHere lies a lawyer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>His wife pursed her lips and said, \u201cNo. \u2018Here lies a lawyer who lies no more\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Marcos caught the mood and said, \u201cNo. \u2018Here lies a lawyer who lies still\u2019.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><u>Note: <\/u><\/p>\n<p>The quotes may have been a knock-off (by Playboy or by Mr. Marcos) from an apocryphal lawyer joke, but the pun is neat.<\/p>\n<p>In Mr. Marcos\u2019 first choice, \u201clies\u201d is unambiguous.<\/p>\n<p>In the second (Imelda\u2019s version) the pun is on \u201clies\u201d (used in two different senses).<\/p>\n<p>In the third version the pun is on both \u201clies\u201d and \u201cstill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&nbsp; PUN &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Subject for September 2016: PUN Like a malapropism, a pun is a play on words, but of a different sort.
