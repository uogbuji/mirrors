Wrong\u2026.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Electric Bill or Electricity Bill?<\/span><br \/>\nAn electric bill is one that shocks you, and it may not be for electricity consumed. A $10,000.00 water bill would be considered \u201celectric,\u201d even if you are Bill Gates. The bill that comes from your power utility is your <strong>electricity bill<\/strong>; it is not electric if it is for $1.50.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Athletic or Athletics?<\/span><br \/>\nThe man that controls and regulates sports in your high school: Is he your \u201cAthletic Director\u201d or your <strong>\u201cAthletics Director\u201d?<\/strong> It depends. If he is muscle-bound and presses 200 lbs., he may qualify to be called \u201cathletic\u201d (which means the same as \u201csportive\u201d); but if he is a 250-lb couch potato that oversees sporting activities from the cushy comfort of an air-conditioned office, the best he can be is an Athletics Director. A school may have a <strong>physics<\/strong> or <strong>mathematics<\/strong> or <strong>athletics<\/strong> teacher (in each case a noun). Those nouns are always used in the plural, never in the singular, so that a \u201cphysic\u201d or \u201cmathematic\u201d or \u201cathletic\u201d teacher makes no sense.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Are you \u201csix foot tall\u201d or \u201csix feet tall\u201d?<\/span><br \/>\nThe <em>foot<\/em> in \u201csix-foot man\u201d is really an adjective. It is called an adjectival noun because, while it is a noun, it functions as an adjective in that construction (qualifying man). It is like saying someone is a house painter: \u201chouse\u201d is an adjectival noun here, qualifying painter.<\/p>\n<p>So, \u201c<strong>I am six foot tall\u201d makes no sense<\/strong> really: it uses an adjective (foot) where it should use a plural noun (feet). A six-foot man is six feet (plural noun) tall; a woman who measures five feet and six inches in height is a \u201cfive-foot-and-six-inch woman\u201d; and a child that weighs fifty pounds is a fifty-pound child. Similarly, a twenty-dollar lunch costs twenty dollars (plural noun). We seem to get confused only when it comes to height! Nobody can be \u201c6 (or 5, etc.) foot tall,\u201d Such a unit of height does not exist. If your height is six feet, then: You are a six footer, a six foot person, or a person six feet tall. Just keep in mind \u201cnoun versus adjective\u201d and you shouldn\u2019t get it wrong.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Transitive &amp; Intransitive Verbs<\/span><br \/>\nDo you <strong>lie<\/strong> down or <strong>lay<\/strong> down? It depends on what is lying or being laid. Americans seem to tip-toe around the verb &#8220;to lay&#8221; because of its sexually loaded nuance. But as children we learned the <em>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John prayer<\/em>: \u201c\u2026Before I lay me down to sleep \/ I give my soul to Christ to keep.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>LIE is an intransitive verb. In present tense , \u201cI lie down\u201d (in past tense, \u201cI lay down\u201d). But LAY is a transitive verb because it takes an object. Thus, a child who is ready to sleep will first <strong>lay her book<\/strong> down and then <strong>lie down<\/strong> (or lay herself down). So, \u201cI will lay down on the couch\u201d is confusing, unless you are a hen laying eggs.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, one version of <strong><em>The Red River Valley<\/em><\/strong> song lyrics says: &#8220;For I know you are taking the sunshine \/ That has lied in our path for a while.&#8221; That is bad English; the last line should read &#8220;&#8230; that has lain in our path for a while.&#8221; Again, the tenses of the 2 verbs are: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LIE<\/span>: Now it <em><strong>lies <\/strong><\/em>in our path; yesterday it <em><strong>lay;<\/strong><\/em> for years it has <em><strong>lain;<\/strong><\/em> tomorrow it will <strong><em>lie<\/em><\/strong>; etc. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">LAY<\/span>: Now I <strong><em>lay<\/em><\/strong> it down; yesterday I <em><strong>laid<\/strong><\/em> it down, for years I&#8217;ve <strong><em>laid<\/em><\/strong> it down; tomorrow&#8230; <strong><em>lay<\/em><\/strong>. But don&#8217;t confuse them with <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">the verb to tell a lie<\/span>: I lie, I lied, I&#8217;ve lied, I will lie; etc.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Prepositions<\/span><br \/>\nSome prepositions are used exclusively or preferentially with some verbs in certain contexts. Thus you \u201c<strong>wait for<\/strong>\u201d somebody (if you are biding time for that somebody to be ready to do something); but you \u201c<strong>wait on<\/strong>\u201d somebody if you are a waiter in a restaurant, an attendant in a shop, or a teller in a bank, for instance.<\/p>\n<p>We have seen the case of \u201c<strong>off<\/strong>\u201d and \u201c<strong>on<\/strong>\u201d in a previous post at this blog site. Each is a complete preposition: \u201cI put the book on the table,\u201d or \u201cI won $5 off him in a bet.\u201d In this context <strong>\u201coff-of\u201d is meaningless<\/strong> (as in \u201cTake your hands off-of me\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>Another surprising error is the saying &#8220;It&#8217;s not that big of a deal.&#8221; What is <em><strong>of<\/strong><\/em> doing there? The correct expression is, &#8220;It&#8217;s not that big a deal.&#8221; Shuffling &#8220;a deal that big&#8221; to read as &#8220;that big a deal&#8221; is good enough; you don&#8217;t have to insert &#8220;of&#8221; anywhere in it.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Life was Peachy!
