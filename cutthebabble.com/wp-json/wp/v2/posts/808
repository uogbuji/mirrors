Essentially, no two words of English are identical (except, perhaps, \u201cbegin\u201d and \u201ccommence,\u201d to cite my high school English master, a doughty, old Irish priest whose <em>Magister of Classics<\/em> was earned in Oxford U of the UK). That being the case, the wider your English vocabulary the wider the range and nuances of meaning you can convey. And that range can be phenomenal!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>April 24, 2017<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>THE FACTS<\/p>\n<p>Charles Berlitz (a US linguist)* said English had \u201cover one million words,\u201d mostly derived from Latin.\u00a0 And he added:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>A highly erudite scholar\u00a0 of English language could command some 100,000 of those one million million words.\u00a0<em> \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hence we shall use 100,000 as the benchmark of high erudition in English Language. <\/em><\/li>\n<li>However, most well-read scholars of English could use or recognize 25,000 to 50,000 of those words.<\/li>\n<li>Shakespeare used just 20,000 different English words in all his works (but that was 450 years ago).<\/li>\n<li>For comparison, The New York Times (of 1980s) utilized about 25,000 English words.<\/li>\n<li>But a UK university graduate mastered only about 10,000 words (10% of our erudition benchmark).<\/li>\n<li>For US college graduates the mastery was much worse: just below 3,000 words (&lt;3% of our benchmark).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong><em>A native speaker of any language who commands less than 3% of its vocabulary is of course failing badly!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We must bear in mind that Berlitz\u2019s statistics are over three decades old, hence outdated. An explosion of new English words has taken place since his time, occasioned by technical and scientific advancements, socio-cultural progress, and the newspeak of the electronic\/cyber age. <strong><em>But this only amplifies the lexical inadequacy of US English.<\/em><\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>[* Numbers quoted here are from <u>Native Tongues<\/u> (Perigee Books, 1984) by Charles Berlitz, a famous US linguist.]<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>ONE EXPLANATION<\/p>\n<p>Non-native users of English tend to acquire their vocabulary in the classroom or from literature sources. In contrasts, native speakers (perhaps Americans especially) seem to do so mainly via conversation (and increasingly TV). Hence the tendency in written US English to confuse phonetically similar words, or to misspell some others (as we saw elsewhere in these blogs) \u2014 for instance:<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>do<\/strong> to\u201d for \u201cdue to\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>principle<\/strong> amount\u201d for \u201cprincipal amount\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>peddle<\/strong> your bike\u201d for \u201cpedal your bike\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>mute<\/strong> point\u201d for \u201cmoot point\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<strong>duffle<\/strong> bag&#8221; for &#8220;duffel bag&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>loose<\/strong> your way in the dark\u201d instead of \u201close your way\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cbigger <strong>then<\/strong>\u201d for \u201cbigger than\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201c<strong>recumbant<\/strong> bike\u201d for \u201crecumbent bike\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cin dire <strong>straights<\/strong>\u201d instead of \u201cin dire straits\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cwhat is <strong>meat<\/strong> for the goose\u2026\u201d instead of \u201cwhat is meet for the goose\u2026\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2026 and so forth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>ANOTHER EXAMPLE<\/p>\n<p>There is a great deal of confusion in US literature between &#8220;farther&#8221; and &#8220;further.&#8221; They are two different comparative forms of the adjective &#8220;far.&#8221; But there is a subtle distinction between them in terms of connotation:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>FARTHER<\/strong><\/em> is the correct comparative form for FAR when it refers to <em><strong>distance<\/strong><\/em>;<\/p>\n<p><strong>FURTHER<\/strong> is the correct comparative form when FAR connotes EXTENT, not distance. Here are examples:<\/p>\n<p>Distance: farther (comparative)-farthest (superlative).\u00a0 &#8220;I walked one mile but she walked farther, two miles.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Extent:\u00a0 further-furthest.\u00a0 &#8220;I invited only adults, but my wife went further and invited everyone we knew.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In one sentence: <em>&#8220;I walked and thought; and the farther I walked down the road the further I considered his idea.&#8221;<\/em><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>So, one might say that vocabulary is the Achilles heel of US English. But Americans are not unique in this regard. All people tend toward laxity over their mother tongue and let the looser forms of conversational vernacular creep into their writings. (My spoken <em>Igbo<\/em> is poor and my written <em>Igbo<\/em> is abysmal!) In contrast, foreigners are likely to become acquainted with the strictures of grammatically correct English before dabbling into spoken English\u2014where their unusual accent is a major cause of self-conscious hesitation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>An Englishman I worked with in the USA made a\u00a0 facetious joke about a US exchange student in a literature class at a London university. A coed tried to start a conversation with the American after class and the following ensued:<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>English coed<\/strong><\/em>: &#8220;Do you like Rudyard Kipling?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>American:<\/strong><\/em>\u00a0 &#8220;Dunno.
