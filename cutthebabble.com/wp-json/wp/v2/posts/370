I have encountered a few questionable uses of the apostrophe two of which are quite wrong, and others that are not generally accepted as correct:<\/p>\n<p>to pluralize a noun, for contraction, and to indicate the genitive (possessive) case:<\/p>\n<p><strong>(1) To Pluralize:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cThe 1970\u2019s were years of unrest\u201d is not generally accepted. The better entry here is 1970s, not 1970\u2019s.<br \/>\n<strong>(2) For Genitive (Possessive) Case:<\/strong><br \/>\n\u201cThe cat lifted it\u2019s tail\u201d is incorrect. Pronouns in the possessive case do not use an apostrophe. The correct possessive pronoun is \u201cits,\u201d not \u201cit\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Related to this example is the confusion of \u2018your\u2019 (possessive case) with \u201cyou\u2019re\u201d (contraction of \u201cyou are\u201d).<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou\u2019re hair is nice\u201d is incorrect: the correct possessive pronoun is \u201cYour,\u201d not \u201cYou\u2019re.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>(3) To Indicate Omissions:<\/strong><br \/>\nThis is the commonest use of the apostrophe: to indicate that letters or words were dropped to make things shorter:<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 \u201c<em>Don\u2019t talk\u201d is correct<\/em>. (Few people makes mistakes in this use of the apostrophe.)<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201c<em>You\u2019re smart\u201d is correct<\/em>; it is a contraction of \u201cyou are smart.\u201d<br \/>\n\u2022 \u201cYour smart\u201d is incorrect. This is the kind of misuse that is becoming rampant.<\/p>\n<p>Since all of the foregoing errors reflect the influence of spoken English on its written form, one can only conclude that composition\/essay (the art of setting your ideas down in writing) is no longer well taught in the USA.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>Anything to Contribute?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The list above isn&#8217;t exhaustive by any means.
