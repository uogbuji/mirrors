For the same reason, the word for photographs (\u201cpictures\u201d) is now routinely replaced with \u201cpix\u201d; and nobody talks about taking a self-portrait (with a cell phone) anymore, but just a \u201cselfie.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Where does it end? And is it really creative? Does it not lead to obfuscation, making an otherwise clear message quite murky? Not long ago the media used to refer to police dogs as a \u201cCanine Unit\u201d (from <em>canis<\/em>, the Latin word for dog). Then someone realized that \u201ccanine\u201d sounded like \u201cK-9\u201d and now even our print media have abandoned the accurate forms and begun to write routinely about \u201cK-9s\u201d in police units.<\/p>\n<p>One wonders why \u201cK-9\u201d is now preferred in US English. K-9 is not easier or shorter to write or say than \u201cdog\u201d or \u201ccanine.\u201d It is not even a clarification: indeed it is the opposite of clarification. Soon students will no longer know or remember the provenance of the term \u201cK-9.\u201d The degradation of our language is going beyond words to embrace the emerging fusion of words and pictures. In cell phone text messaging \u201cU\u201d stands for <em>you<\/em>, \u201cur\u201d for <em>your<\/em>, \u201c2\u201d for \u201cto,\u201d and \u201c4\u201d for \u201cfor.\u201d Thus, \u201cI heart u\u201d means <em>I love you<\/em> (the heart becoming a proxy for love). Now, try and translate \u201cA K-9 is gud 4 u\u201d; that\u2019s the standard English of cell-phone texting, no doubt the English language of tomorrow.<\/p>\n<p>And then there\u2019s the fastest-growing sector of obfuscation: the perceived need to \u201csupersize\u201d every existing word, especially adjectives. It used to be a thing was small, medium, or large (big); then, with time, along came \u201cenormous\u201d from Latin <em>e-normis<\/em> (literally out of the normal); later we discovered \u201cgigantic\u201d (for \u201cbig as a giant\u201d) and \u201ctremendous\u201d (causing a quake by its sheer size!). Then the\u00a0 \u201cbaby-boomer\u201d generation created \u201chumongous\u201d (perhaps a cut-and-nail amalgam of \u201chuge\u201d and \u201cmonstrous\u201d). Nowadays, teenagers combine \u201cgigantic\u201d and \u201cenormous\u201d to fashion \u201cginormous.\u201d Inundated as we are with frenetic commercial advertising, we have all become self-boosters now, leap-frogging one-another with escalating comparisons.<\/p>\n<p>Where will it all end?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>March 15, 2017 The telecopying of document (i.e. creation, transmission, and recovery of facsimiles) was with us for almost a century, from the dawn of telephony \u2014 but not very&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[3],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/791"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=791"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/791\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":794,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/791\/revisions\/794"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=791"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=791"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=791"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
