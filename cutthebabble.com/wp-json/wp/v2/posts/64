And so the rot spreads because lawyers are the most ubiquitous and most glorified professionals in the USA. An American is more likely to go through life without needing a doctor than without needing a lawyer! Lawyers are very important role models in the USA. And lawyers simply love obfuscatory verbiage because they make documents sound impressive.<\/p>\n<p>I scratch my head whenever I see \u201cincluding but not limited to\u2026.\u201d The word &#8220;including&#8221; is completely adequate here; it needs no bells and whistles. The clothes in my closet include shirts, but they are not limited to shirts: I have pants and jackets too. It is IMPOSSIBLE to find a case where \u201cincluding\u201d implies that what is included constitutes the whole category under reference. To see this clearly, draw a rectangle and inside it draw a circle. Your rectangle includes the circle but is not limited to the circle: there are things (areas) that lie within the rectangle but outside the circle.<\/p>\n<p>So whenever I see that \u201c\u2026but not limited to\u201d I delete it. My lawyer does not seem to notice the deletion; or he does not mind because he knows it is totally tautological: it adds no meaning or clarification.<\/p>\n<p>What of \u201cin any way, shape, or form\u201d? What distinction do \u201cshape\u201d and \u201cform\u201d add to the phrase? How about \u201cin and of and by itself\u201d? \u201cIn itself \u201cis adequate and everything else there is tautology. While we may blame such chain-link deployment of prepositions on lawyers eager to impress us, there is a new kind of preposition that is more baffling, and the origin of which is more nebulous. English usage in America seems to have evolved a new preposition, \u201coffof\u201d: as in \u201cGet your hand offof me!\u201d Or is it off-of? Ofof? Of-of? I guess I\u2019ve never seen it in writing, so anything goes here. What is wrong with saying just \u201coff\u201d (\u201cGet your hands off me\u201d)?<\/p>\n<p>Such creations start when someone makes a mistake and others latch onto it as a new style. An apparently even more recent creation is \u201cThe problem is is\u2026\u201d What is the second \u201cis\u201d doing here? Someone probably heard a speaker say \u201cWhat this is, is a mistake,\u201d (which is correct English) and the listener (who cannot \u201chear\u201d the comma after the first \u201cis\u201d) then thought that \u201cis is\u201d is cute. A similar nonsense is \u201cthe reason being is\u2026.\u201d One can say, \u201cI came late. The reason is that I missed my bus.\u201d Or you can join the two sentences into one by changing is to being: \u201cI came late, the reason being that I missed my bus.\u201d But you can\u2019t keep both is and being together right there (and say: I came late, the reason being is\u2026.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One suspects that such mangled sentence formulation comes from the American habit of taking our cues from \u201ccelebrities.\u201d Celebrities are persons who have achieved fame through their hard work (one hopes) in specific, narrow spheres of human endeavor. Such achievement does not make them all-round gurus. In fact, in most cases a celebrity status was attained through the habit of practicing just one role in life and, unfortunately, devoting less time or none at all to education. The child who watches lots of movies but pays scant attention to her English teacher at school is likely to become an adult who speaks gobbledygook!<\/p>\n<p>American children (and increasingly children the world over) learn much more from television than from school, for two reasons. One is that much more time is devoted to TV watching than to school work or home work. Another is that the presenters on TV (including actors especially) are spellbinding because they are cute, while the harried teachers in class are drab. So perhaps our society can ameliorate he problem by requiring that script writers for TV programs be quite literate and competent!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Everybody now feels compelled to say, \u201cincluding but not limited to&#8230;\u201d because it sounds sophisticated: all lawyers insert it into contracts and letters to impress laypersons, or more likely because&hellip;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":607,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[9,1],"tags":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/2.jpg","_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=64"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":83,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/64\/revisions\/83"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/607"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=64"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=64"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/cutthebabble.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=64"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
