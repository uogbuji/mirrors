<p><b>Angela France:&nbsp; Occupation (Ragged Raven Press, 2009)</b></p>
<div class="just">
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">T</span>his collection is a cabinet of curiosities, teeming with haunting visions which return the words ‘marvellous’ and ‘wonderful’ to their real meanings. Angela’s poems occupy a mysterious hinterland&nbsp; of everyday life. She often lulls us into a sense of security by her detailed and vivid observation of nature, and then a door swings open into the strange and unknown, into a world of seductive fantasy and unexpected humour.</p>
<p>I was drawn in and captured by these poems like the mariners in her mythic ‘Sea Hare’: “the sea-hare slips from water forms…&nbsp; she rides the storms on ribbons of kelp… to guide lost sailors home to her green-lit halls”. Angela has a gothic imagination, a ghoulish tenderness — she weaves spells of hares and witches. In ‘The Real Bedtime Story’ she tells us, “I’m the thing under your bed”, “the bloody smear on crystal slippers”, “the itch / that sends the wolf to speak in tongues”. In ‘Preparations for a Working Day’, she solemnly instructs, “select a round stone to keep/ in your mouth”, concluding “Above all,/ inspect your hat-feathers with care;/ if any have splits/ or dusty edges/ they will not light/ your way back.”</p>
<p>Her enticing and provocative titles give a flavour — (and are a found poem waiting to be worked): ‘Sea Hare’, ‘Rejecting Gravity,’ The Mortician Speaks of Hands’, ‘A Fallow Blooming’, ‘Learning To Play The Violin By Holding a Bow’, ‘A Country Road Becomes a Prayer’, Diamonds and Toads’, ‘The Hangman Speaks of Art’, ‘Gravedigger’s Bane’, ‘Mothering the Unmade’, ‘Mrs Houdini Sorts Through His Last Effects’, ‘The Shapeshifter’s Wife’, ‘ ‘Our Restless Dead’, ‘A Pederast Speaks of Home’, ‘The God of Lost Letters’, ‘Victor Knows the Danger of Words’, ‘ The Colour of Shame’, ‘The Memory Keeper’. These tantalising titles hold promises which the poems never disappoint. ‘The Mortician Speaks of Hands’ demonstrates her breadth of imagination, her humanity, and a penetrating clarity of vision in its surprising end. ‘Rejecting Gravity’ is a wild fantasy about flight, with a twist in the tail which made me laugh out loud.</p>
<p>The poems are lovingly peopled with the odd, the misplaced, the obsessive, the misfits, the wordless, a butcher “with the thud of cleavers in his laugh”. One&nbsp; woman gently removes her skin in front of a mirror, another hatches an egg between her breasts (is it dragon, bird, flying fish?), another vividly and filmically becomes a tree as “tendrils of creamy roots/ twist between toes”; another covers herself with sugar-water to encourage bees to swarm over her chest, neck and face, “every/ tiny foot telegraphing obeisance”.
</p>
<p>Angela has the gift of the true nature poet to slow us down and show the world afresh, “straight as the fox’s/ bloody thought”. In ‘Call and Return’ “Pigeons clapper into an expanding sky”, a violet is “hunkered in a bony fold of root”, and “messy squabbles of starlings/ cloud from branches, flies weave and bob/ above slow cows and I am ready. I am ready”. The close observation of ‘Wild Strawberries and Blind Snakes’ leads us quietly to a metaphor which strikes like the snake itself. ‘The Rhubarb Patch’ captures the “tart shock” of adolescence as much as rhubarb itself. ‘Beeing’, which opens with the unnervingly apt plural, “When I was bees”, is perhaps an elegy for youth, a time when we “lived for the drunken plunge/ into flower hearts /gold dusted bumbled back /carried the world in our bent elbows”.</p>
<p>These are poems rich as fruit cake, dense with delicious images: “Sunday simmers for hours in the kitchen”, “houses bloom on a bend”, “years weight heavy on the roof/ curving the spine”, “the garden leans on the walls”, “the shoppers and registers/ tingle like a rash, a tinnitus”.</p>
<p>And there’s an undercurrent beneath the surreal and the grotesque, which surfaces most clearly in ‘The Message’, a poem for two 6,000 year-old skeletons, locked in an embrace, ”there is only one word./ I see it in the L bend of elbows, the roundness of skull,/ the v where your thighs touch”.</p>
<p>She chooses, fittingly, to end the collection with a poem called ‘first things’, about the possibilities of imagination in a prosaic world. Read these poems for their juxtaposition of the strange with the everyday, for rich and vivid language, for an other-worldly mythology and resonant insight.</p></div>
