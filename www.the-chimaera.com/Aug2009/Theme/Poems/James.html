<h4>A City with Green Fingers</h4>

<p>
<em>&nbsp;for Professor Helen Armstrong</em></p>
<p>Green fingers ought to reach from land to sea<br />
When Brisbane is two hundred old miles long,<br />
And punctuate its continuity<br />
Like breathing spaces built into a song —<br />
Lest glass and concrete irretrievably<br />
Convert a whole coastline into Hong Kong:<br />
This you convinced me of, one fine spring day,<br />
As we stood at the edge of Moreton Bay.
</p>
<p>You drove me through the fields of sugar cane:<br />
One house per hill, one little hill per mile.<br />
Developers would see a land in pain<br />
Aching to be a sea of brick and tile.<br />
I still thought, though it went against the grain,<br />
Less greedy planners with a sense of style<br />
Might do their best as they did what they must.<br />
What else can suburbs eat but the earth’s crust?</p>
<p>The car ran out of road at the bay shore.<br />
There was a jetty, pilings, a few boats,<br />
A single single-storey general store<br />
With cakes and ice-cream, sinkers and cork floats —<br />
At first I thought there might be nothing more<br />
But found, among my hasty mental notes,<br />
A startling fact. On every piling stood<br />
A pelican as if carved out of wood.</p>
<p>I’d barely asked “Are they alive, those things?“<br />
When the whole flock prepared itself for flight.<br />
Posing girl gymnasts, they uncranked their wings<br />
And took off all at once as if to fight<br />
The Luftwaffe. We watched them running rings<br />
Around the sky before they dived to bite<br />
The water like ditch-diggers. For the fish,<br />
Not quite, perhaps, the finish they would wish:</p>
<p>Nevertheless, here was the world we made<br />
Unmade to what it always might have been<br />
If the first men had failed to make the grade<br />
And died off leaving the whole pristine scene<br />
Intact. A never-never everglade,<br />
It reacquainted me with blue and green<br />
As primary colours. “Children should see this,”<br />
I said, and you said, “This is what we miss.”</p>
<p>We miss it most, of course, the less aware<br />
We are of what was bound to be destroyed<br />
By our urge to create. Raised in the glare<br />
Of artificial light, we treat the void<br />
Within ourselves as if it wasn’t there.<br />
We’re pleased, if not exactly overjoyed,<br />
When cities grow to prove us, too, a force<br />
Of nature infinite in its resource.</p>
<p>Nor do our modern Babylons and Troys<br />
Always rate nought on the aesthetic scale.<br />
Night-time New York’s a song that never cloys<br />
By Gershwin, and does Paris ever fail<br />
To bring the rapture of unwrapping toys<br />
At Christmas back to mind? It’s a false trail,<br />
However, to think one man, in advance,<br />
Can replicate the play of time and chance.</p>
<p>And even he, the dreaming genius<br />
Of new Brasilias and Chandigarhs —<br />
Computer diagrams that dazzle us<br />
Like science-fiction schemes to join the stars,<br />
With neon tunnels for the shuttle-bus<br />
And looping freeways for electric cars —<br />
Will throw in the odd pikelet of green park<br />
To make his stunning project look less stark.</p>
<p>He should take his own hint, and leave the view<br />
Open for good long stretches to the tide<br />
So that his exponential spanking new<br />
Brainchild can lie unseen on either side<br />
While people rest from know-how and can-do<br />
And the upthrust output of their vaulting pride<br />
By contemplating how the world of men<br />
Came from this, and might come to this again.</p>
<p>Time the surveyor can be given pause —<br />
And our sad dwelling-place a chance to last —<br />
By taking thought, turning the thought to laws<br />
And setting fines for those who drive too fast<br />
When drunk with power. Concern has been your cause<br />
Your whole life long, and so, as in the past,<br />
It will <i>quand vous serez bien vieille, Hélène</i>.<br />
I’ve always loved you and will love you then,</p>
<p>Both for your beauty that defies the years<br />
And for your spirit that defies the age.<br />
Aware my maunderings recall King Lear’s,<br />
I’ve put my late-found wisdom on the page<br />
To reassure you your blood, sweat and tears<br />
Have paid off. Even I see the next stage<br />
Will prove your point that we must share the earth<br />
With the earth itself, or what else are we worth?</p>
<p>Green fingers of a giant, generous hand<br />
Spread and extended to the thundering beach.<br />
Green fingers stretching from a hinterland<br />
Too far back for the outer works to reach<br />
Of the self-besieging city. Surf and sand<br />
Open to all by right. The things you teach<br />
Will help keep hope alive when we are gone,<br />
Helen. Your quest is good. May it go on.</p>
