		<h4>Captain Lee</h4>
<p>Lee’s father died the night that Lee was born<br />
By falling down a well. He’d drunk too much.<br />
He was the one Lee’s uncle calls the lush.<br />
Lee’s mother sang in clubs. They tried to warn<br />
Her not to trust the SOB who’d torn<br />
Her dress and forced her in his car to touch<br />
His crotch then cried. But she was in a rush<br />
To wed, though all their marriage brought was thorns,<br />
Or so the note his father left had said.<br />
When Lee turned twenty-one, his uncle gave<br />
The note to him. “Our secret. Let the dead<br />
Stay dead. No one needs to know I saved<br />
It.” So, Lee hid the note behind his bed<br />
And keeps his father’s secret in the grave.</p>
<p>Lee rises every day at dawn. The rose<br />
That bleeds each day to orange, then gold, then blue<br />
Is music for his eyes. He likes how dew<br />
Ignited by the sun dances and throws<br />
Off sparkling light like jewels his uncle shows<br />
To buyers at the store, the people who,<br />
His uncle says, can see a stone has true<br />
Worth only when they see how bright it glows.<br />
Lee likes the way his uncle always tries<br />
To help. He buys his mother clothes. He finds<br />
Odd jobs for Lee and doesn’t realize<br />
That Lee can’t learn, although in teacher’s minds<br />
Lee’s always been unteachable. Lee’s days<br />
Shine like rubies lit by his uncle’s praise.<br />
<br />
Lee’s uncle told him once, “Enterprise earns<br />
Respect. You do a job. You win a game.<br />
People make it a point to know your name.<br />
That goes for learning too. The man who learns<br />
Is not the one who quits and idly yearns<br />
For things others say he’s no right to claim.<br />
All that comes from quitting’s feeling shame.<br />
But work and study both will get returns.<br />
I know they told you you were dumb. But a lie<br />
Can’t change what’s true, and thorns won’t keep a rose<br />
From bloom. And you will bloom. I’ll tell you why.<br />
You’ve watched the sun. You’ve seen the way it burns<br />
Away the night. Well we can be the same<br />
And burn up demons dressed in teachers’ clothes.”<br />
<br />
Lee’s mother tried to sympathize. “I’ve seen<br />
The way my brother’s words could calm a flock<br />
Of hungry crows. But listen when he talks<br />
To what he doesn’t say. He doesn’t mean<br />
To hurt you. But his argument implies<br />
Your life’s your fault, your woes all self-imposed.<br />
What keeps you down’s not laziness. You grew<br />
Inside me wrong. Your blood in my womb drew<br />
From mine the retribution for my highs<br />
And lows. I drank. I’d reasons, but the whys<br />
Don’t matter. Blame your mother. Your uncle knows<br />
You can’t do things the same as others who<br />
Are right. He shouldn’t tell you enterprise<br />
Can remedy those things I can’t undo.”<br />
<br />
Like ensigns on the bridge, the birds outside<br />
Lee’s window sound alerts, and anyone<br />
Who hears them knows how long before the sun<br />
Appears. Lee takes his post as daylight slides<br />
Across the edge of night. A captain’s place<br />
Is at the helm. When Lee first heard the world’s<br />
A wanderer through space, it made no sense.<br />
The sun came up, went down, the stars encased<br />
By night came back and didn’t change, like pearls<br />
Inside an oyster, Lee behind a fence.<br />
But when Lee heard of Enterprise he knew<br />
And understood. The earth’s a bridge, and dawn’s<br />
The power source that’s kept him moving to<br />
Where only he and no one else has gone.</p>
