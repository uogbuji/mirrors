<h4>The Bigger Picture</h4>
<p>You saw it on TV — the footage showed<br />
The mighty Ozymandian overthrow,<br />
The falling statue and the cheering crowd —<br />
And probably believed that it was so.<br />
But see the picture taken from above<br />
In black and white, a single grainy still<br />
Which irresistibly reminds one of<br />
The early work of Cecil B De Mille.<br />
The close-up cheering of a small élite<br />
Was caught on careful cameras, but not<br />
The roadblocks at the end of every street<br />
Lest uninvited extras spoiled the shot<br />
Of History being created there<br />
In one small corner of an empty square.</p>

<h4>The Red Mud of Lydney</h4>
<p>On a field trip to Gloucestershire, not long before he died,<br />
The tired leaves of autumn were committing suicide<br />
To the threnody of drizzle which was clearly in cahoots<br />
With the red mud of Lydney that was sucking at my boots.</p>
<p>We were following our colleagues to the villa on the hill<br />
With Philip in the wheelchair, doing splendidly until<br />
We heard a noise behind us such as speedy people make<br />
And turned and saw a four-by-four that wished to overtake.</p>
<p>The cure for our predicament was well within his gift;<br />
His flat bed trailer might have offered us a lift,<br />
But he gave the horn an irritated toot as if to say<br />
That he was heading up the hill and we were in the way.</p>
<p>The man in the Land Rover didn’t try to pass,<br />
He made me lug the wheelchair through the lateral morass.<br />
He watched me as I struggled and he wouldn’t meet my eye,<br />
Just raised his own to heaven with a hissy little sigh.</p>
<p>It took me every ounce of strength to haul it off the track<br />
And I knew as I was doing it I’d never haul it back.<br />
He found a gear and roared away and left us helpless there.<br />
Oh, I would’ve pulled my forelock if I’d had a hand to spare.</p>
<p>Each time I see the wheelchair standing empty in the shed<br />
Still muddily encrusted in that special shade of red<br />
It galls me and appalls and transports me back again<br />
To the loneliness and hopelessness of Lydney in the rain.</p>

<h4>Risk Assessment</h4>
<p><i>Written at the request of Blaenau Gwent Council prior to</i><br />
<i>a series of poetry workshops in Bryn Bach Park. 20.06.04</i></p>
<p>The whole enterprise is fraught with hazard<br />
When you come to think about it. No parent<br />
Would ever let their child participate<br />
Knowing the full extent of the danger.<br />
Huddled for an hour in a sweaty tent<br />
With only a poet to take care of them?<br />
They could be inappropriately touched,<br />
Approached by some ungodly reprobrate<br />
Offering to show them skylarks in return<br />
For a quick peep at their budding talent.<br />
They might catch fire; rub two ideas together<br />
And — <i>poof!</i> — spontaneous creativity!<br />
Addiction is a possibility<br />
And the susceptible may find themselves<br />
Unable to resist the strong compulsion<br />
To indulge repeatedly in the habit,<br />
For, as the wise poet wrote on the packet,<br />
This stuff can seriously affect the heart.*</p>

<p class="smaller">*<i>paraphrasing</i> Elma Mitchell’s <i>This Poem...</i></p>
<p class="smaller">
[‘Risk Assessment’ from <i>Between Dryden and Duffy</i>]</p>


<h4>Changeling</h4>
<p>He stretches out his hand across the desk.<br />
“About the size” he says “of the first joint<br />
of my little finger.”&nbsp; I look, carefully.<br />
It isn’t that much larger than my own.</p>
<p>One unstressed syllable of a dactyl.<br />
The end of ignorance; a piece of poetry.<br />
Surely too small to be malevolent?<br />
Just inconvenient and untoward.</p>
<p>Real living tissue, single-mindedly<br />
Bent on continuing its own existence<br />
Looking to me for nourishment and safety<br />
Which it is in my power to deny.</p>
<p>He offers me a moment to decide,<br />
Which I decline. I do not have a choice.<br />
I shall abort you, little afterthought,<br />
But not without a ripple of regret.</p>
<p>I wanted to have a picture of you;<br />
I tried to buy one on the day they found you<br />
But I was told the deal did not apply<br />
To neoplasms — “only to babies”.

<h4>Dear Heart...</h4>
<p>I’d like a word with you, my inner poem;<br />
Have you time? I know what it is you’re doing<br />
Now I have seen for myself the breakdown<br />
Of your new independent prosody,<br />
The red ink dwelling on the random stresses<br />
Of your undisciplined running rhythm.</p>
<p>We have outgrown the iamb, you and I;<br />
I, having lately come into my strength<br />
Am stimulated by experiment<br />
Nevertheless, it’s hard to see my own<br />
Meticulously orchestrated epic<br />
Dissolving into syncopated prose.</p>
<p>What do you have in mind for the coda?<br />
Is it the quick kick and the sudden silence<br />
Of a brisk Audenesque buggering-off<br />
Or will it have a touch of comedy,<br />
Me bowing out to fibrillating giggles<br />
As you die laughing?

<h4>Not Much News...</h4>
<p>
How nice of you to ring. So unexpected.<br />
No. I’m not busy. Yes, I’m on my own.<br />
I wasn’t doing anything important.<br />
Just happened to be sitting by the phone.<br />
You don’t have to apologise. As always<br />
You got the benefit of any doubt.<br />
I didn’t feel neglected in the slightest,<br />
I just assumed you’d rung while I was out.<br />
Odd that you should have caught me at this moment,<br />
First time in ages that I’ve thought of you.<br />
Oh, blue-arsed fly, love, if you get my meaning,<br />
It’s been a very busy week or two.<br />
I’ve read a lot of proofs for other people.<br />
I’ve drafted several chapters of the book.<br />
It didn’t register you hadn’t written;<br />
I haven’t hovered long enough to look.<br />
I’ve caught up with a load of correspondence<br />
And over half of it has been to you.<br />
I tore it up and told myself I’d sent it<br />
Because that’s what unhappy people do.<br />
Gave myself toothache biting on a bullet.<br />
Was not much taken with the taste of lead<br />
So spat it out and wrapped it in a hanky.<br />
Opted for doing something else instead.<br />
Decided to apply the skills God gave me<br />
To doing something that I do quite well;<br />
Made an asbestos jacket for a snowball<br />
So as to give it half a chance in hell...

<h4>The Defeated Hare Questions the Value of Retromingency</h4>
<p>
<i>Trick question: what can the hare do that the tortoise can’t?<br />
Smart answer: urinate backwards</i></p>
<p>
(This is one for the TAPITS — the generous people who hand me such<br />
serendipitous <i>trouvailles</i>, along with the promise “there’s a poem in that”.)</p>
<p>It blinks as it slinks bandy-leggedly into the spotlight<br />
To the roar of the crowd and the laurels and the champagne<br />
And yes, you can guess at the cause of the celebration:<br />
Hey, no shit, Sherlock — the tortoise has done it again.</p>
<p>I am flat on my face on the ferny floor of the forest.<br />
I’ve been snivelling, dribbling and muttering into the moss<br />
And wiping my eyes with my ears (and it can’t do that, either)<br />
And telling myself that I don’t give a twopenny toss.</p>
<p>I ought to be used to it, given how often it happens;<br />
It’s the way of the world and I don’t have the right to complain<br />
But it hurts and I’m sad and I wish it were me on the rostrum.<br />
I’m alone in the dark and the tortoise has done it again.</p>
<p>Omniscient Pan, who distributed gifts to your minions,<br />
Why on earth did you give me a retrodirectional cunt?<br />
For what is the point of the power of pissing behind me<br />
When the tortoise is always, always, always in front?

<h4>First-footing</h4>
<p>Sun on the snow. We are first up, first out<br />
To lay our claim to the unprinted page.<br />
I trudge great boots along the lower margin.<br />
Dog scribes his private joy across the slope<br />
In wild graffiti, praising his own nature,<br />
Writing as the ox ploughs, the ancient way,<br />
Turning the footprints like Etruscan script<br />
Now right, now left, in his innocent progress.</p>
<p>We lie at last in animal communion<br />
Looking down at our own handiwork —<br />
Manipulated whiteness, bearing witness<br />
To two fools’ early-morning fortitude.</p>
<p>Look. Bottom left hand corner. Something stirs.<br />
A squirt of multicoloured bobble-hats.<br />
Children, coming about their own business.<br />
Lids of recycling boxes, plastic bags<br />
Lugged up the field, trundled across our writing<br />
And ridden down and down and down again<br />
Obliterating all our evidence.
</p>
<p>A universalising metaphor...<br />

Don’t even think about it. Home. Soup. Crossword.</p>

<h4>Dialogue </h4>
<p>He might be coming tonight, said Heart to Head.<br />
No he won’t, Head replied, firmly. You heard what he said.<br />
I know, said Heart, but still he didn’t exactly<br />
turn me down flat.<br />
Well, he wouldn’t, would he? said Head,<br />
you know him better than that;<br />
what he said was “barring a miracle” —<br />
I thought you understood.<br />
Granted, he did, said Heart, but he also said<br />
he would if he could.<br />
If he’d meant to come, said Head, he’d have mentioned trains;<br />
he’d have confirmed the time.<br />
So he forgot, so what? said Heart.<br />
Since when has that been a crime?<br />
Go on, said Head, firmly but gently. Pick up the phone,<br />
ring and un-book the hotel.<br />
Not yet, said Heart. But I will.<br />
Why do you carry on playing, said Head<br />
when there’s so little chance of winning?<br />
Poor Head — am I “doing you in”? said Heart, grinning.<br />
Death, even by a thousand cuts, said Head,<br />
is still, ultimately, Death.<br />
“Hope springs eternal in the human breast”,<br />
said Heart, under its breath.<br />
That was unworthy of you, said Head,<br />
it’s a cliché, and it’s ugly.<br />
“<em>L’espoir luit comme un brin de paille dans l’étable</em>”,<br />
said Heart, smugly.<br />
Straw doesn’t shine in stables, said Head,<br />
it just lies there, soaking up shit.<br />
That’s right, said Heart. That’s it.<br />
Face it, said Head, not unkindly; he isn’t coming tonight.<br />
I know, said Heart. But he might.</p>

<h4>Blue Juice</h4>
<p><em>Familiar name for Sodium Pentobarbital, <br />
drug of choice for veterinary euthanasia…</em></p>
<p>
Ultimate catflap, petdoor into eternity<br />
And all the other merry euphemisms<br />
That blur the hard edge of an act of love.<br />
Blue Juice; tincture of courage and compassion<br />
A rite of passage and a consummation<br />
Of life which has simmered down to essences.</p>
<p>Blackberries, bleeding into the soft palms of children<br />
Who snatch and swap and stuff their greedy mouths<br />
With the free sweetness of the countryside,<br />
Returning home with innocence belied<br />
By the stigmata of their self-indulgence.</p>
<p>Bilberries. Rough wind on the high moors.<br />
Pulling each other down among the wires<br />
Out of its blusterous reach. Helping ourselves<br />
To the rare opportunity of each other<br />
Despite the splatterbruises of the berries<br />
Printing their small betrayals on our skin.</p>
<p>Indelible pencil, drawing illicit pictures<br />
On a licked forearm, making blue tattoos<br />
That shimmer in the spit.</p>
<p><i>Atropa Belladonna</i>, gentle purple,<br />
Offering itself to me in the garden.<br />
The light is going and I am alone.<br />
I am aware of all the old wisdom,<br />
The <i>do not touch the tree</i> imperatives<br />
But finger and thumb reach out instinctively<br />
To take the dare, to pick the fruit, to eat,<br />
To stain my lips with the forbidden juice<br />
Until I dance like Mark Antony’s soldiers,<br />
Cannot distinguish truth and fantasy,<br />
Lose my already ineffective voice<br />
And fly till flying takes my breath away.
</p>
<p><img height="292" alt="" src="../images/BlueJuice.jpg" width="210" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Water</h4>
<p><em>For Kenneth Steven, who asked for it</em></p>
<p>Its small manifestations move me most.<br />
The jewelled trickle on a chilly bottle.<br />
The snotty gobbets of dissolving frost<br />
on nostril-whiskers of outwintered cattle.<br />
The cold sheen covering a limewashed wall<br />
where the upwardly mobile damp has gathered.<br />
The diamante shimmer over all<br />
the webs with which the windowframes are feathered.<br />
Bright drops tossed from the wet necks of cormorants<br />
who have begun to come too far upriver<br />
in search of what the sea no longer grants,<br />
questioning our perception of forever.<br />
I write my name in it, careful and clear,<br />
to watch it dull, dry up and disappear.

<h4>New Fruit</h4>
<p>In the last knockings of the evening sun<br />
Eve drinks Calvados. Elsewhere in her life<br />
She has played muse and mistress, bitch and wife.<br />
Now all that gunpoint gamesmanship is done.<br />
She loves the garden at this time of day.<br />
Raising her third glass up to God, she grins;<br />
If this is her come-uppance for her sins<br />
It’s worth a little angst along the way.<br />
A fourth. Again the cork’s slow squeaky kiss.<br />
If, as the liquor tempts her to believe,<br />
The Lord has one more Adam up His sleeve<br />
He’s going to have to take her as she is —<br />
Out in the garden in a dressing-gown<br />
Breathing old apples as the sun goes down.</p>
