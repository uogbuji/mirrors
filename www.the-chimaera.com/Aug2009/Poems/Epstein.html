		<h4>Wednesday: Theme and Variations</h4>
<i>Wednesday<br /></i><br />
Among these sparrows, frogs, and chickadees,<br />
Finally warmed by sun instead of steam,<br />
Too early for the shift to certainties,<br />
Pentameter to prose, maybe I dream<br />
Of sex and violets. Perhaps I know<br />
What scientists on salary forecast:<br />
This Thursday, patchy fog and early snow.<br />
Their spring comes early, but it does not last<br />
Forever. So I’m told. No season does<br />
Which lies beneath the dirt today. Tomorrow<br />
The violets will be the spring that was.<br />
They lend me verse. Whatever else I borrow,<br />
I offer back, as though I had a choice.<br />
First day of spring, this is my winter voice.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Whensday</i></p>
<p>Dr Dee and his chicks, that brood who read<br />
Fire and numbers, every comet signed,<br />
What good are they? Their sun is not a head<br />
Of state. Mere shape lives only in the mind,<br />
In digs where violence dwells, sex of a kind,<br />
Like ringing changes on these lilybells.<br />
He knew his time, he told his time. And then?<br />
I heard the answer. Like the heart, it tells<br />
The count. It told the weather, but not when.<br />
I take my time. It will be small and soon.<br />
He only heard the pitch of notes that men<br />
Are built to hear. I think I heard that tune<br />
Performing here. The feeder and the grass<br />
Bear the refrain: “A lass, my love, a lass.”</p>
<p><br />
<i>Wedsday</i></p>
<p>Nobody claimed that flowers are untrue<br />
Because they claim their pollen from the wind.<br />
Imagine being proffered that by you —<br />
“It was the zephyr did it. I’m unskinned,<br />
I’m virgin as a stone.” Of course you are.<br />
The hyacinths immaculately flower.<br />
They took their color from a passing star<br />
While you were sleeping: some ungodly hour<br />
When spring believed that nobody was watching.<br />
Tulips push through. The grass begins to sweat.<br />
Troo-loo the song the songbirds have been hatching.<br />
Trust is a cycle. If we do the same,<br />
We get it back. And no one knows its name.</p>
<p><br />
<i>Wendsday</i></p>
<p>A pilgrimage, spring having sprung, we go<br />
The places we go every day, to see<br />
What sun has done to change the world we know:<br />
It starts from scratch, except for me and thee.<br />
We are not what we have been, more and less,<br />
Parts shed, augmented, by and large forgotten.<br />
We still can flower — there is that, God bless —<br />
So fertile we, so much to work with, rotten<br />
Right to the corps. They call these zephyrs. Feel<br />
Commotion in the ground? No? I don’t either.<br />
From this point forward, nothing much is real —<br />
No pilgrims, Aprill, smalle foweles neither.<br />
Spring forward. Fall back. Either way, we stand<br />
Right where we are, not sky, not wholly land.</p>
