		<h4>The Annexe</h4>
<p>A small lit room,<br />
With the undistinguished furnishings they love,<br />
That Afghan rug of intricate design<br />
You seem to be looking down on from above<br />
At some great height — and, should the camera zoom,<br />
The vistas, worlds, on hold<br />
Within that pattern, line by woven line,<br />
Would open and unfold.</p>
<p>The television,<br />
With sound turned down, is flourishing its phantoms,<br />
A synopticon in time-lapse of the ages<br />
Where history can perform only in tantrums<br />
Too quick to take in. Free of such misprision<br />
A subdued music plays<br />
Its tireless permutations and upstages<br />
Time in more subtle ways</p>
<p>Philosophers<br />
Would weep to hear. The windows are all blind<br />
Now that the blinds are drawn, but on the walls<br />
Their memories are suspended to remind<br />
Whoever turns to look there what occurs,<br />
Even without a viewer,<br />
The moments that each pictured scene recalls<br />
That somewhere may endure.</p>
<p>Two heads of hair<br />
Above the sofa back they rest against<br />
Are tilted to each other, where they grant<br />
The omniscient narrator all that’s sensed<br />
Between them unobserved, all that they share,<br />
To which the words they use,<br />
These worn-out whispered nothings, are the scant<br />
And ineffectual clues.</p>
<p>Outside the door,<br />
Cold-lit and cold, the edifice is still,<br />
Without a voice. The passages and stairs<br />
Wind through the middle of the night until<br />
Their pattern and the night are ever more<br />
Inwoven, seen as though<br />
From some great height, at which one scarcely dares<br />
To gaze for vertigo.<br />
&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>Paris</h4>
<p class="epigraph">“A film can be about Paris, but Paris is not about anything.”</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know: it’s Paris. Neatly sliced<br />
A little way below the summit, rises<br />
The steely fabric of the Eiffel Tower,<br />
Flanked, or it seems to be from this perspective,<br />
By two elaborate flagpoles, each one decked<br />
Halfway with some excrescence that may be<br />
A giant flowerpot, or conceivably<br />
A mounting for loudspeakers, if they had<br />
Loudspeakers then, in 1889,<br />
And at the top, a tricolour in the form<br />
Of a forked pennant flexing in the breeze<br />
Like someone dangling there and hanging on<br />
For dear life, kicking desperately in air.<br />
A smudgy white and fairytale pavilion,<br />
Positioned near the tower’s base, presents<br />
The focus of the scene, to which the crowds<br />
Are streaming from both right and left, well wrapped<br />
Apparently against late autumn cold.<br />
Some of the trees, young planes perhaps, are still<br />
Quite densely leafed, though that can hardly be<br />
In view of how advanced the season is;<br />
But on the other hand at the far left<br />
There is a tree that’s almost bare. The sky<br />
Is blanked out by a quilting of chill grey<br />
And vaguely threatening cloud. What’s it about?<br />
Come on. No jokes. Don’t say: “It’s about to snow.”<br />
Don’t tell me it’s about three forty-five.<br />
Do not inform me condescendingly<br />
And with exhausted patience: “About Paris.”</p>
<p>Or put it this way. In the north Atlantic<br />
So many miles from land that land might well<br />
Have never been, an outcrop of dark rock<br />
Juts minimally, intermittently,<br />
From massive surges of sea swell, from smacks<br />
Of shattered and collapsing waves and walls<br />
Of storm-built ocean water. In the day’s<br />
Last flourish spume and spray climb up and up<br />
And hang as though absolved from gravity.</p>
<p>Across a fissured butte in Arizona<br />
A wingèd shadow glides, time and again<br />
Nicked, bent and twisted by the transverse cracks<br />
That score the scarlet rockface in the sun.<br />
</p>
<p class="endnote">(The poem refers to the painting <em>Entrance to the the Universal Exhibition, 1899</em> by Jean Béraud)</p>

<h4>The Transaction</h4>
<p>There. There it was just then in that split second.<br />
So transient, so fit to miss,<br />
Like an infection floating on a cough<br />
Or swimming on the lip gloss of a kiss.<br />
Something in her expression beckoned,<br />
He spoke the words and, breaking off,<br />
They found in her their metamorphosis.</p>
<p>Now, as she walks away, what he recalled — <br />
Still hidden like the blue tattoo<br />
Of a hummingbird that flutters underneath<br />
Her restless skirt — is starting to imbrue<br />
Her memory, instantly installed<br />
With imagery to bequeath,<br />
Dimensions that are hers to wander through.</p>
<p>She could dance blindfold through that house. Her throat<br />
Begins to tighten when that name<br />
Is merely spoken and her eyes grow wet.<br />
She feels the outrage move her to exclaim,<br />
Knowing that rogue survives to gloat.<br />
She shares the joke she didn’t get.<br />
She sighs and sees that day go down in flame.</p>
<p>Without a second thought or least suspicion<br />
She threads the network of the streets<br />
As ever, beckoning and beckoned to,<br />
The courier of everyone she meets.<br />
And he who passed on this commission<br />
Has the same business to pursue,<br />
Outlays forever balanced by receipts.</p>
<p>Who knows? In this assignment one brief message,<br />
One simple picture has descended<br />
Beyond imagining, almost unchanged,<br />
From the first word and, almost unamended,<br />
Will bear its chronicle and presage<br />
Until the earth itself’s estranged<br />
And the passage of the swollen sun is ended.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>
How Long Have You Been Having These Feelings?</h4>
<p>So I made it to the portal<br />
And stopped to rub my eyes.<br />
Here was the guy who would immortalize</p>
<p>The cure for mumps with bracken.<br />
I checked him off my list:<br />
Astral adviser and tobacconist.</p>
<p>His name plate was the rebus<br />
Of an untranslated quote<br />
In neon from the end of the Liebestod,</p>
<p>Flanked and borne up by hatted<br />
And handbagged parodies<br />
Of Kath and Kim as caryatides.</p>
<p>“Remind me to forget it,”<br />
I thought. “My mind’s a sieve.<br />
This game’s becoming too competitive.”</p>
<p>I had to grope the doorman<br />
Before he’d let me past<br />
And stepped from Mother’s Day to Gormenghast.</p>
<p>He was acting like a madman<br />
Doing salsa with a desk.<br />
His stance was Wildean, wit Bradmanesque.</p>
<p>“Is this the place?” “Who’s asking?”<br />
“It’s me. Consult my nape.”<br />
He scribbled something down on masking tape</p>
<p>And, reaching for me slowly<br />
(Could he really move so slow?),<br />
He stuck it on my blue portfolio</p>
<p>And said, “Now wait a minute.<br />
Pick a number between three<br />
And the left-hand square root of infinity.”</p>
<p>I bluffed, “How about a googol?”<br />
“Pass, crow. When you’re reborn<br />
I’ll play it for you on the flugelhorn.”</p>
<p>As I stumbled down the hallway<br />
I heard the doorman shout,<br />
“He makes appointments but he’s always out.</p>
<p>But if you’re very very<br />
Lucky — lucky as sin — <br />
You just might find his secretary in.”</p>
<p>She was. The chair she sat in<br />
Swung round. “Well, I am vexed.<br />
I can’t make head or tail of this Latin text.</p>
<p>Do you have the tongue?” “I’d rather<br />
You didn’t ask,” I lied.<br />
“It brings me out in hives since my father died.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry to embarrass<br />
A man of pure intent,<br />
Subjecting him to textual harassment.”</p>
<p>I was hot under the collar<br />
And my cuffs began to drip.<br />
“How do you rate on pluvial scholarship?”</p>
<p>She reached for the weather index:<br />
“Hmm. Inventory of rains<br />
With references that the wind explains.</p>
<p>Ah: ‘Hung from its isohyets<br />
Like curtains, rain as yet<br />
Is silent on the question why it’s wet.’”</p>
<p>“That so? You’re quite a wonder — <br />
So much at your command.”<br />
I hoped she’d think that I could understand.</p>
<p>“I’ll set you one more challenge,”<br />
She said, “you may prefer,<br />
Unless you’re shy as J D Salinger.”</p>
<p>She had some mole — or freckle — <br />
That she asked me to inspect.<br />
It took some finding, as I recollect,</p>
<p>And a good deal of laughter<br />
From her — buttons and cords — <br />
And a long time in the bathroom afterwards.</p>
<p>“Is this,” I asked, “all licit?”<br />
And she replied, “Why, sure.<br />
My pulse was checked by the solicitor.”</p>
<p>Then she rubbed me with her flannel<br />
And grabbed me by the wrist<br />
And said, “Report me to your analyst.”<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>The Red Sea</h4>
<p>Lulled in a nook of North West Bay,<br />
The water swells against the sand,<br />
Hardly more liquid than Venetian glass,<br />
In which clear surface, just a little way<br />
From shore, some four or five petite yachts pass<br />
With languid ease, apparently unmanned,<br />
Adrift along the day,</p>
<p>Imagining a breeze to fan<br />
Their motion, though there’s none. Siobhan<br />
Reaches a giant hand down from the sky<br />
And nudges with insouciant élan<br />
The nearest hull, her bended waist mast-high.<br />
That hand is just as magically withdrawn.<br />
So moves the catamaran.</p>
<p>And through the Lilliputian fleet<br />
She, Beatrice and Gabrielle<br />
Wade in the shallows, knee-deep, spaceman-slow,<br />
To fashion their manoeuvres and compete<br />
Among the stationed hours to and fro,<br />
While watching through the viscid slide and swell<br />
Of water their white feet,</p>
<p>Made curiously whiter by<br />
That cool light-bending element.<br />
Doubled by shadows on the sand they glimpse<br />
Pipefish and darting fingerlings they try<br />
Impossibly to grab, translucent shrimps<br />
Among the lace weed, seahorses intent<br />
To flee the peopled sky.</p>
<p>Hard to conceive that they should be<br />
Precisely who they are and here,<br />
Lost in the idle luxury of play.<br />
And hard to credit that the self-same sea<br />
That joins them in their idleness today,<br />
Careless of latitude and hemisphere,<br />
Blind with ubiquity,</p>
<p>Churns elsewhere with a white uproar,<br />
Or wipes the Slave Coast clean of trees,<br />
Or sucks among the scum and floating drums<br />
Of some forgotten outpost founded for<br />
The advent of an age that never comes,<br />
Or bobs the remnants of atrocities<br />
Limply against the shore.</p>
<p>What luck they have. And what good sense<br />
To leave the water with their toys<br />
When called, before their fortunes are deranged.<br />
And still the day hangs in its late suspense<br />
For hours without them, virtually unchanged,<br />
Until the bay’s impregnable turquoise<br />
Relaxes its defence</p>
<p>And sunset’s dye begins to spread<br />
In flood across it to the sand<br />
They stood on, as though, hoping to disown<br />
The blood of all the innocents he’d shed,<br />
Macbeth incarnate or his grisly clone<br />
Had stooped on some far shore to rinse his hand,<br />
Making the green one red.</p><p class="endnote">[ First published in <em>Australian Book Review</em> ]</p>

<h4>Tralee</h4>
<p>And later, wondering, “Can this be true?”<br />
I looked out at the night to scan<br />
The alphabet of stars we stood beneath,<br />
But could not read. This took me unawares.<br />
I heard you giggle as you cleaned your teeth<br />
And say, “There is a naked man<br />
In my kitchen.” I might have quipped to you<br />
If I’d been quick, “Well, don’t look now, but there’s<br />
A naked woman in your bathroom too.”</p>
<p>We found a lot to laugh about. Recall<br />
My joke and your hilarity<br />
About the Englishman who asked his way<br />
Of an old man in Kerry, who replied:<br />
“Well now, if I was goin’ to Tralee<br />
I wouldn’t start from here at all.”<br />
Long into that first luscious night we lay<br />
And talked, and more than talked, there side by side<br />
In moonlight, with the quilt thrown back, asprawl</p>
<p>And stroking, and your streaming hair was wide<br />
Across the pillow and my chest,<br />
And underneath its fall our lingering lips<br />
Kept meeting and exchanging what they met,<br />
And my hand laid its weight between your hips.<br />
My little life was soon expressed,<br />
And I was happy to hear you confide<br />
And sad to find how soon your eyes were wet<br />
And happy too to kiss them till they dried</p>
<p>And in my shoulder’s crook you laid your head<br />
And slept, and I’d have slept but who<br />
Would sleep when he could watch your sleeping face,<br />
And hear your murmured breathing. But the fact is<br />
Face value is just that and leaves no trace.<br />
I took all that you said as true<br />
But what is true is more than what is said,<br />
And maybe after all your years of practice<br />
Your body’s mastered how to lie in bed.</p>
<p>But that sounds bitter. Pardon me. Why blame<br />
A woman who right from the start<br />
I saw could not be good for me but still<br />
Desired so badly you might well assert<br />
That I conspired with you to break my heart.<br />
Well, not a charge I would disclaim.<br />
The fact is the explanation, and you will<br />
Do what you wish. No point in crying hurt.<br />
We know there are no rules in the great game.</p>
<p>
No rules, but consequences should be clear.<br />
To hear on that last morning your<br />
Last words, “Think of the good things, let’s be friends,”<br />
As though a wounded heart’s a frippery,<br />
As though love’s really ended when it ends.<br />
The path we took was no detour.<br />
There is no other way. And oh, my dear,<br />
If you still think that we might reach Tralee,<br />
The truth is that we cannot start from here.

<h4>The Kiss</h4>
<p>How can she do this now that it’s all changed,<br />
Present her lips to kiss<br />
As though that known face were the same as this<br />
From which you’ve been estranged?<br />
Of course it is. Here, now? Or then and there?<br />
How can she sit down in her cloud of hair</p>
<p>And watch you as though you were someone else?<br />
You are, of course, to her.<br />
You were this rendezvous’s commissioner<br />
And nobody compels<br />
Your self-distressed attendance here but you.<br />
So watch her do as only she can do.</p>
<p>She lifts her left hand to her left earlobe<br />
And tugs the earring, slides<br />
The hook half out and rubs at it and glides<br />
It in, as its purple globe<br />
Swings back and forth to tantalize your sight.<br />
Soon she will do the same thing with the right.</p>
<p>A silver bracelet rides along one arm<br />
Or settles at the wrist,<br />
And lest adornment should seem prejudiced<br />
The other has its charm<br />
As well, made somehow perfect by the dent<br />
That mars the curve of its encirclement.</p>
<p>And those two combs holding her hair in place,<br />
Two combs of tortoiseshell — <br />
And when she took them out, oh how it fell<br />
At night around her face,<br />
Which she would lift to you and shut her eyes,<br />
So beauty came to seem beauty’s disguise,</p>
<p>And whether by desire or candlelight,<br />
Her skin took on a glow,<br />
An alabaster lucency, and so<br />
She leant back to invite<br />
Your open-mouthed assent. And you would hold<br />
That pose like two Klimt lovers cloaked in gold.</p>
<p>And that first night you slid the purple shift<br />
Over her shoulders and<br />
Peeled gently downwards, leaving her to stand<br />
In Aphrodite’s gift,<br />
And sinking with her garment to the floor,<br />
Made moist the shadowed fold you knelt before.</p>
<p>How can she do this now that you’re estranged,<br />
Stand in her cloud of hair<br />
As though she were the same, though well aware<br />
That everything is changed<br />
(Of course she is), presenting for your kiss<br />
The mouth that was the mouth that is not this.</p>

<h4>Incident at Grantley Manor</h4>

<p>

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
(Recorded reading by Stephen Edgar from his CD <em>Photography for Beginners</em>, used here by courtesy of Carol Jenkins, <a href="http://www.riverroadpress.net" target="_blank">River Road Press</a>)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven o’clock, the time set in his mind<br />
Like herbs displayed in aspic, as the chimes<br />
Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes’</p>

<p>Black leather tread, pacing those measures down<br />
The first-floor hall, where sunset’s apricot<br />
Was oozing nectar through the open doors.</p>

<p>Her voice, conspiratorial and astonished,<br />
Called him across the bedroom’s drowning cube<br />
Towards the window. How well Miss Waterson</p>

<p>Remembers it: “Please come and look at this,<br />
Mr Devine;” the clock on the mantelpiece<br />
Rehearsing for the hour of seven. She pointed</p>

<p>Down. There, a moving picture on the lawn,<br />
His father, like a patient whose long months<br />
Of immobility meant learning afresh</p>

<p>The art of walking, climbing the light’s green slope<br />
Towards the summer house, looking intently<br />
As though for a cuff link or a signature.</p>

<p>That evening he still thinks of, lying now,<br />
No longer needing lessons for his legs,<br />
How he cast back his glance and saw the windows</p>

<p>Blazing like cats’ eyes on his uselessness,<br />
And in that golden mirror, two gold figures<br />
Recording him, two shadows of dark gold — </p>

<p>Miss Waterson (was it?) and another one — <br />
And then took out his watch on which the hands<br />
Were so meticulously assembling seven.</p>

<p>Young Emily, appointed just the week<br />
Before, came rushing to the stairs — she’d seen<br />
Him stumble — to advise Mr Devine</p>

<p>About his father’s fall. And so, almost<br />
Immobilized herself in that clinging syrup,<br />
She observed the hall clock’s quaint rendition of</p>

<p>Seven, the time set clearly in his mind<br />
Like summer herbs in aspic, as the chimes<br />
Were striking. Then the squeaking of his shoes’</p>

<p>Black leather tread, pacing those measures down<br />
The corridor, where sunset’s apricot<br />
Was oozing nectar through the open doors.</p>

<p>Her voice, companionable but astonished,<br />
Floated across the bedroom’s drowning cube<br />
As he descended. How well Miss Waterson</p>

<p>Remembers it: “Please come and look at this;”<br />
And Emily, who had just been taken on<br />
That week, came rushing to the window. She pointed</p>

<p>Down, smartly on the stroke of seven. There,<br />
A moving picture on the lawn, was old<br />
Mr Devine, like a patient whose long months</p>

<p>Of immobility meant learning afresh<br />
The art of walking, climbing the light’s green slope<br />
Abstractedly towards the rose garden.</p>

<p>That evening he still thinks of, lying now,<br />
No longer needing lessons for his legs,<br />
How&nbsp; he cast back his glance and saw the windows</p>

<p>Glaring like cats’ eyes on his helplessness,<br />
And in that golden mirror, two gold figures<br />
Gesticulating, two shadows of dark gold — </p>

<p>The new girl (was it?) and another one —<br />
And then took out his watch on which the hands<br />
Were so laboriously assembling seven.</p>

<p>Miss Waterson, with Emily behind her<br />
In a panic, dashed to the stairs to find<br />
Mr Devine, anxious to let him know</p>

<p>About his father’s fall. And there they saw him,<br />
Almost immobile in that clinging syrup,<br />
And heard the hall clock’s muffled tolling of</p>

<p>Seven, the time set firmly in his mind...</p>

<h4>Observations of an Attendant</h4>
<p>The river surface, restless as a child,<br />
Keeps shifting round its iridescent blues<br />
In shirrs and stretch marks, quiltings which are styled<br />
For nothing, or for what we choose to choose.<br />
Would an alien be naturally impressed<br />
By random lulls which here and there anoint<br />
That creased expanse with their pooled oils, or<br />
Imagine himself blessed<br />
In watching the parched hump of Droughty Point<br />
Slope to the water’s damage at the shore?</p>
<p>Abruptly up the dazzle-shivered fairway<br />
From nowhere, faintly haze-veneered, arrives<br />
A flight of gannets, wheeling through the airway<br />
Their self-professing loops and sudden dives.<br />
With syncopated, jazzlike intuition<br />
And a white flash, they plunge in turn to feed<br />
Through the crumpled current, rise and loiter there<br />
In stranded exhibition;<br />
And then on wings that less loft than impede<br />
They heft their dripping bulks back in the air.</p>
<p>The watcher too is lifted — yet estranged<br />
Behind the glass that changes what exists.<br />
Here ranks of gamblers, safe inside, arranged<br />
In concentration like telephonists,<br />
Or programmers at terminals, intent<br />
On serious work, play out their solemn rites<br />
Of wish and habit, to the idiot-<br />
Inspired accompaniment<br />
Of electronic jingles, and bright lights<br />
Which signal that reluctant, rare jackpot.</p>
<p>In their oblivious midst crumples unnoticed<br />
Onto the carpet stretching under her,<br />
In thoughtful silence, without fuss or protest,<br />
Saving the etiquette of her milieu,<br />
An ageing modest woman — a dead weight<br />
To the attendants, eager for the chance<br />
Of something to attend. Mild interest<br />
Seems to reanimate<br />
Some patrons in the nearer seats, whose glance<br />
Flickers from her back to the keno, lest</p>
<p>They miss their winning numbers. How grey her face<br />
Becomes, how artificial her drained skin,<br />
How shocked her fearful eyes for the disgrace<br />
She’s caused. But no: their look is turned within,<br />
Withdrawn in some more private protocol<br />
That has no need of comfort, soothing hands,<br />
The flurry of official signs of care.<br />
For she herself is all<br />
The sign that she can read, and it demands<br />
All of the concentration she can spare</p>
<p>In this lacuna in the afternoon.<br />
And watching her, I listen with concern,<br />
As a mother might, to my own breathing. Soon<br />
The living colours in her face return.<br />
She’s wheeled from view. The watchers all become<br />
Immediately absolved of this brief farce<br />
That went unwitnessed a few feet away.<br />
That strange blue medium<br />
Continues as before beyond the glass,<br />
Assuming to itself the entire day.</p>
<p>Gulls dressed in their immaculate livery<br />
Practise towards a strident unison.<br />
From here out to the smeared periphery<br />
The river’s blank. Those gannets are long gone,<br />
Taking their appetites to other regions.<br />
The mountain’s top fades in a veil of light,<br />
Ruled off by shadow, with a chiffon scarf<br />
Of cloud. A flock of pigeons,<br />
Wheeling, turns on and off again in flight,<br />
Flashing their presence like a heliograph.</p>
<p class="endnote">[ From the collection <em>Lost in the Foreground</em> ]</p>
<h4>Penshurst</h4>
<p>Sometimes we’d wander half-day holidays<br />
Licensed as in a dream to roam at large,<br />
Through afternoons of Empire Days, or those</p>
<p>More mundane times when we’d wag school, a friend<br />
And I, and ramble home circuitously,<br />
Traipsing the mid-hours of the suburbs, when</p>
<p>They’d sunk into their fabled lifelessness,<br />
The great Australian emptiness: the men<br />
Away at work, the faceless wives indoors,</p>
<p>Possessed by their invisibility,<br />
Streets in suspense, deserted like a scene<br />
From <em>The Quiet Earth</em>, apart from some roused dog,</p>
<p>The grace notes of the birds, mad Geiger-counting<br />
Of cicadas (it seems always summer),<br />
A Hill’s hoist thinly shrieking, and hidden away</p>
<p>Somewhere behind the streets the intermittent,<br />
Companionable clatter of the trains — <br />
That rataplan I’d often lie awake to</p>
<p>Late in the night in bed, muffled far off,<br />
A goods train from the south that never seemed<br />
To arrive, pass or recede, but simply hung</p>
<p>Its soporific rhythm’s interminable<br />
Comfort across the wide deceptive miles — <br />
And the reassuring weight of houses, safe,</p>
<p>Repeated like a children’s story, always<br />
The same, their modest privacies behind<br />
Net curtains intimately suggestible,</p>
<p>Indifferent; and all of it so far<br />
From any need to happen or explain,<br />
Be puzzled over or be otherwise.</p><p class="endnote">
