<h4>Polishing Off the Sherry</h4>
<p class="epigraph">&nbsp;...my eyes, like the Sherry in the Glass, that the Guest leaves...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;— from the letters of Emily Dickinson</p>
<p><img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="326" alt="" src="../images/sherry.jpg" width="220" align="right" border="0" />Refracted lamplight casts a flame,<br />
a gloss on what she wrote,<br />
an amber flash that toasts her name<br />

and lubricates my throat.</p>
<p>The glass I leave’s an empty one;<br />
I polish off each drop.<br />
It’s only when the bottle’s done<br />
that I know when to stop.</p>
<p>Were I a Homestead guest on those<br />
nights of superb surprise,<br />
I’d kill the means by which she chose<br />
to acquaint us with her eyes.
</p>

<h4>Happy Hour</h4>
<p class="epigraph">&nbsp;Now is the night one blue dew, my father has drained, he has coiled the hose.<br />
&nbsp;— James Agee, <i>A Death in the Family</i></p>
<p>My father, if my memory serves me well,<br />
never contended with a hose at dusk,<br />

but chilled Beefeaters as his ritual,<br />
then swirled the pitcher with a marble whisk.</p>
<p>My mother sat across from him, and crossed<br />
her dancer’s legs, while Perry Como sang<br />
about a falling star.  Lamplight caressed<br />
their faces as if nothing could go wrong.</p>
<p>Whether a father drains and coils the hose,<br />
or sips a dry martini with his wife<br />

while crooners from the hi-fi bend a note,<br />
the ease of custom moors him to his days,<br />
holds fast against the ebb and flow of life.<br />
He’ll switch to bourbon when his luck runs out.
</p>

<h4>Brightening As They Fail</h4>
<p>&nbsp;— for Anthony Hecht</p>
<p>
Autumn’s pale foliage comes curtsying down,<br />
As elms release a quiet, amber rain.<br />
The punctual sky collects its summer loan<br />
Of blue, and yellow’s all that’s left of green.</p>
<p>I’m in the habit of a lowered gaze,<br />
Absorbed in nature’s horizontal screen,<br />
Askim with fall’s ecliptic matinees<br />
Of pas de deux deciduous ballets.</p>

<p>Without exception, each leaf joins its shade<br />
And stops the dance with breathless certainty;<br />
It’s what’s supposed to happen, after all —<br />
The sombrous kissing game, the mute cascade,<br />
The sun’s diminished luminosity,<br />
The shadow creeping up the garden wall.</p>
<p class="endnote">[ Originally published in <em>Cadenza </em> ]</p>

<h4>At the Summer Poetry Festival</h4>
<p class="epigraph">— after Dick Davis’s “At the Reception”</p>
<p>Ah there she is, all siren-like and fair,<br />
The one who needs a boost with her career.<br />
She has a manuscript she’s bandying;<br />
I’ve heard it’s so-so, but I’ll praise the thing.<br />
My Pulitzer and sultry, southern lilt<br />
Routinely do the trick; she’ll all but wilt<br />
Into my arms. I see she wears a ring.<br />
So much the easier to have a fling.</p>
<p>She’s caught my stare. I’ll raise my glass and wink.<br />
What luck, she has my book and wants a drink,<br />
And I am right between her and the bar.<br />
<em>Sign it for you? With pleasure, yes, my dear.<br />
No pen? No matter. Later on we’ll go<br />
And look for one inside my bungalow.</em>
</p>

<h4>Soldier on the Plane</h4>
<p>He could have been a messenger from Mars,<br />
part boy, part man, and part machine of battle,<br />
conspicuous in desert camouflage,<br />
boarding Southwest from Oakland to Seattle.</p>
<p>His earth I.D. read, “U.S. Army Harte.”<br />
“Defending Freedom” spanned the copperplate<br />
around his wrist.&nbsp; From boot to crown, clean-cut,<br />
straight-laced, a fledgling ace at brawls of state,</p>
<p>that troop was good to go.&nbsp; The paperback<br />
he opened up was purest, raw pulp fiction.<br />
The cover spelled out loud and clear its stark,<br />
impelling title: <em>Violence of Action</em>.</p>
<p>He stared into it deeply, as a child<br />
into a jar of tadpoles or a cage<br />
containing well-loved creatures of the wild,<br />
and calmly understood and turned each page —</p>
<p>Or so it seemed to me as I observed<br />
his young, decided, stationary face.<br />
A mind’s a narrow vault when it’s resolved,<br />
and one idea freezes it in place.</p>
<p>I liked to think the pen clipped to his shirt<br />
might serve as Harte’s survival gear for wit,<br />
a sidearm to fire questions or assert<br />
some doubt. I wished him luck deploying it.
&nbsp;
</p>
<h4>“When the swallows come back to Capistrano”</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; [Popular song — Leon Rene, 1939]</p>
<p>It’s easy to forget what brought them here,<br />
since those ideal conditions pre-exist us;<br />
but still it’s fun pretending every year.</p>
<p>In fact, the feathered migrants go unmissed as<br />
long as the fiestas and parades go on,<br />
as boisterous and bankable as Christmas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lagoons with mud for nest-building are gone,&nbsp;<br />
paved over for itinerants in cars,<br />
and almost any bird that soars at dawn</p>
<p>will pass for those once-faithful comeback stars.<br />
The mission bells are loud and punctual.<br />
The mariachi trumpets and guitars</p>
<p>assault the loudspeakers as usual,<br />
and Aztec dancers with their drummers follow.<br />
The first-graders perform in whimsical</p>
<p>felt beaks and wings, “Good Morning, Mr. Swallow.”<br />
Then comes the old hit song beloved by all,<br />
whose chorus of return, however hollow,</p>
<p>must, at all cost, be sung each spring and fall.<br />
Nostalgia holds humanity in thrall.<br />
A man-made mud-nest clings to the north wall.
