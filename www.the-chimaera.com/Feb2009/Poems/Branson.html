		<h4>The Green Man</h4><p class="smaller">
“What means these ridiculous monstrosities in the court of cloisters?”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — St Bernard of Clairvaux, 1125<br />
<br />
“The symbols are ingrained in the psyche... and have not changed since the dawn of human existence.”
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — G. R. Varner</p>
<p>Shaped from heart wood, hard stone, no figment, flesh<br />
and blood transformed by low-born artisans,<br />
these fiendishly-depraved eyesores, symbols<br />
employed to decorate high corbel, font,<br />
roof boss, bench end and startled misericorde,<br />
kept fussy church officials ignorant<br />
of what they represent, the living sap<br />
within the gnarled dark root, those furtive eyes<br />
above old chapel doors, the dancing men<br />
and stag-horns peeping out from altar screens.</p>
<p>Jack in the Green’s abroad. No begging game<br />
by lean black chimney sweeps in garish clothes<br />
led by a hobby horse, wild kettle drums,<br />
whistles and frying pans, this one’s for real.<br />
D’you understand? There’s something present here,<br />
an energy, the spirit dormant in<br />
each cell of plants we eat and flowers we smell,<br />
the air we breathe. These days George Green’s afraid<br />
we lack the cunning to sustain, the time<br />
for trees to beat retreat, habituate.</p>

<h4>
Into the Jaws of Death</h4>
<p class="epigraph">“Someone had blunder’d”<br />
— Tennyson: “The Charge of the Light Brigade”
</p>
<p>Parade of faces, broadsheet wise, all spent:<br />
Gibraltar Forward Operations Base,<br />
Afghanistan, 2 Para,last week’s news.</p>
<p>As liable to be killed or maimed as in<br />
the First World War, you chase the Taliban<br />
through corn high as an elephant’s eye, point-blank:<br />
pure comic book, like rabbits in headlines.</p>
<p>It's called “<em>The Mouth of Hell</em>”: the constant threat<br />
of skirmish, mortar, sniper, mine, vest bomb;<br />
phone pictures for the blokes back home — “<em>Respect</em>!”</p>
<p>No wonders why or truck with politics,<br />
the recipe: take youthful fervour, add<br />
close comradeship, fall pride (“<em>No holding back</em>”),<br />
incessant drill, adrenalin; stir well.</p>
<p>No pause for air cover, boots melting in<br />
the sun, hit them head on: “<em>They choose the ground.<br />
No sweat, we charge straight through their ambushes.</em>”</p>
<p>June 12th, you’re tossing sweets to kids who laugh<br />
and point beyond the track across a stream.<br />
You take a look. They open up, sheer weight<br />
of fire indelible: “<em>Hard rock ’n’ roll.</em>”</p>
<p>“<em>Man down!</em>” You’re hot as blazes till that first<br />
shot’s fired, then cold as ice: slow — quick, quick — slow,<br />
weird time. Word’s out two more have done and died.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Collateral Damages</h4>
<p>1.</p>
<p>When mums wheel kids to see the animals,<br />
you are surprised: not one’s put out, by cows,<br />
eyes concrete-mixers; sheep, hapless shipwrecks.</p>
<p>Days past, at hiring fairs, house servant, stock-<br />
man, shepherd, teamster, field-worker, milkmaid,<br />
flogged off time-place in chunks just to survive.</p>
<p>They say, way back, people were traded here,<br />
freely, at market rate, like these poor beasts,<br />
confirmed by custom, blessed by church and state.</p>
<p><br />
2.</p>
<p>This is a battlefield, laid-out, with ups<br />
and downs, in four dimensions, further than<br />
the eye can see; towards infinity.</p>
<p>What will they think a century from now?<br />
We kill and maim yet mostly put it down<br />
to fate. Nobody blinks; no one’s to blame.</p>
<p>War of attrition: don’t know when or where<br />
next strike will be, who’ll pay the price. Flower shrines,<br />
like henges, mourn each fresh blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>No handicaps are given out for weight<br />
or size, the biggest monsters trading blows<br />
with smallest cars, mopeds and peddle bikes.</p>
