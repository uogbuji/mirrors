		<h4>Mad Annie Explains All</h4>
<p class="smaller"><em>For all the people who make assumptions about the bunch of babies’ dummies that hangs by my front door.</em></p>
<p>In the house of the hanging noonoos<br />
At the sign of the surrogate tit,<br />
In mysterious mess lived an anchoress<br />
Who collected discarded kit.</p>
<p>At the house of the dangling didies<br />
She created an installation<br />
That turned each find of the comforter kind<br />
To a source of inspiration</p>
<p>Till her cherished collection of cushies<br />
Became a delightful distraction<br />
Whenever she thought in more depth than she ought<br />
About oral satisfaction</p>
<p>And under the tumbling numnums<br />
She would sit by herself and sigh<br />
At the pitiful waste that her lapse of good taste<br />
Exposed to the public eye.</p>
<p>For they sell them in packets of seven<br />
As an easy commitment to bliss,<br />
A knee-jerk reaction to dissatisfaction,<br />
An over-the-counter kiss</p>
<p>And each of the colourful dumdums,<br />
As far as she could discover,<br />
Had slipped from the grip of an infant lip<br />
Like a taken-for-granted lover</p>
<p>And if anyone noticed its downfall<br />
It was always discreetly ignored<br />
Till the madwoman came and pocketed same<br />
To add to her magical hoard.</p>
<p>Now she sits by herself in her hovel<br />
With the relics that should have been binned<br />
And the noonoos, the numnums, the little kiss-condoms<br />
Revolve in the winnowing wind.</p>
<p><img height="300" alt="" src="../../images/madannie.jpg" width="280" border="0" /></p>
<h4>My Lover Bought Me Saffron...</h4>
<p>My lover bought me saffron<br />
From a reputable grocer<br />
And in my grinning innocence<br />
I thought it brought us closer,<br />
This meticulous attention<br />
To my culinary needs<br />
With the penises of crocuses<br />
And promises of seeds.</p>
<p>But he has long been absent now<br />
And I am growing sick<br />
Of the limited potential<br />
Of a vegetable dick.<br />
So long has he been missing that<br />
My store is almost gone<br />
And I have used up all the little<br />
Phalluses but one.</p>
<p>I seized it with a tweezers<br />
And upon my palm it lay<br />
With its propagating powder<br />
That my breath could blow away<br />
And I stumbled on a secret<br />
That I never knew I knew;<br />
I closed my eyes and made a wish<br />
And pursed my lips and blew.</p>
<p>I have spiced the space between us<br />
With a cloud of yellow dust<br />
And my lover will be drawn to me<br />
As magic says he must<br />
And I will cook him kedgeree<br />
And memory madras,<br />
With the jissom of a blossom<br />
As a little <em>coup de grâce</em>.</p>
<p>I will fill him up with fantasy<br />
As far as I am able<br />
And I will entertain him<br />
From my place across the table<br />
And look into his laughing face<br />
And lose myself among<br />
The golden ghosts of promises<br />
Upon his silver tongue.</p>
