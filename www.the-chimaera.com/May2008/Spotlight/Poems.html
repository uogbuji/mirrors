<h4>At the Ice Hotel</h4>
<p></p>
<p>My head tilts to the Arctic moon<br />
Slender in its sky.<br />
My daughter will ride soon<br />
On a reindeer sledge, to marry.<br />
I do not see the white buck rear<br />
While she laughs, shrieking, swept past fear.<br />
<br />
Moon swells. I watch the reindeer stand<br />
Poised on its snow-splayed feet,<br />
Its lip flapped on its handler’s sleeve.<br />
Sky soars, so far from heat<br />
As the priest ducks the hide-hung door<br />
The air’s frost rimes her rough fair hair.<br />
<br />
But how she sings, wrapped in grey wool,<br />
Of fire and ice, North’s spring,<br />
While fingers clench against blue chill<br />
In reindeer skins’ rough settling.<br />
The young man fumbles white gold’s flash,<br />
My daughter laughs.The young priest laughs,<br />
By walls of ice, with breath of glass.<br />
<br />
Then they are gone, clung to the sledge<br />
Tied with one loop of string.<br />
Next week I may walk heated winds,<br />
Sun like the deer’s eye widening,<br />
But wish no better future soon<br />
Than Northern light, this Arctic moon.</p>

<h4>Thermal</h4>

<p>Sulis Minerva, they found your stone head<br />
In Bath, where my daughter drove me today,<br />
Half-Roman, half-Celt. Do not lecture. Instead<br />
We wade through blue pools from the sulphurous spring<br />
In a bubble of freedom, my fifty-fourth birthday,<br />
In rooftop baths, by the gulls’ wavering.<br />
<br />
How hard she works, my dark Grecian daughter,<br />
Hands clenched on the wheel, quick glint of her rings,<br />
Marriage, new job. How heavily water<br />
Oiled by the sulphur, smoothes each winter limb.<br />
Roman pipes pump to a Celtic languor.<br />
By rose-red chimneys, I rise and swim.<br />
<br />
Sulis Minerva, they took both your names<br />
Into the dark which I fear will come back.<br />
When you rose into daylight, girls’ eyes shone the same<br />
With shivering shoulders which longed for the south.<br />
With rough hair of weed, eyes sunken and black,<br />
Water, not word, wash us warm through your mouth.</p>
<p><img height="300" alt="" src="../images/thermal2_400.jpg" width="400" border="0" /><br />

<h4>Your signature is required</h4>
<p>Oh reading wills I mourn them:<br />
my father’s upright hand,<br />
careful from the village school.<br />
So his father wrote, his mother<br />
shaped child’s letters, crimped like pastry,<br />
pinched, like the cowslip’s petal.<br />
Who will write like that again?<br />
And then, her zeros,<br />
more trouble than a pleasure,<br />
lawyer’s chill trick, a second will,<br />
the day my mother slept.<br />
<br />
But the tax is saved. I sign<br />
in my slanted dashing hand.<br />
I walk the broad path, common,<br />
to the hill we do not own.<br />
The bramble’s flowers raise storms,<br />
palest golds, rough creams and browns,<br />
the gatekeepers, the butterflies<br />
of hottest harsh July.</p>
<p>So I know that they are safe,<br />
so, forgetting them, I pass<br />
a C of moon so tender<br />
she must not be glimpsed through glass.</p>

<h4>The Book of Weeds</h4>
<p><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="315" alt="" src="../images/weeds1_210.jpg" width="210" align="right" border="0" />It is like your fierce love (I am lazy)<br />
to yearn to name each weed. You could<br />
go crazy<br />
<br />
Naming. Aren’t the named enough? Sow thistle<br />
bleeds white, cinquefoil swarms yellow stars.<br />
I whistle<br />
<br />
As horsetails old as birds cut through my hand,<br />
bindweed chokes roses. The nameless?<br />
I have planned<br />
<br />
For all good souls, a Book of Weeds, to take<br />
the purple spires from shifted soil,<br />
sour ache<br />
<br />
Of crushed leaves with their briefest rosy flower,<br />
onion-scented stems, whose bells drop<br />
in an hour.<br />
<br />
No, close the book. Fling down your trowel and knife.<br />
All weeds grow one name only.<br />
It is life.</p>


<h4>Carving</h4>
<p>A man is writing about sharpening knives.<br />
He is told: the down stroke makes a burr,<br />
The up stroke takes it off.<br />
He does not understand.<br />
<br />
I am properly scornful, for I know of burrs,<br />
I have sucked them from my fingers. But I cannot sharpen knives.<br />
My grandfather flew them, whistling with the blade.<br />
<br />
Voices have burrs,<br />
I hear her live on air.<br />
She was my friend, for years, a stranger.<br />
How her voice slows and slurs and hooks my heart.</p>

<h4>Redemption</h4>

<p>Yes, the Prince will come; but not to marry,<br />
Will, like an angel, wave the prison keys,<br />
Sweep up on horseback just as the deserter<br />
Faces the lifted guns. Songs tell us these<br />
Most hopeful ends. We dream of the Good Ruler;<br />
Justice, not love, is the last dream we carry.<br />
<br />
The songs were lies. The Prince has gouty feet,<br />
He stays indoors. What we want, we must do,<br />
Though it will cost us love and all sound sleeps:<br />
Print leaflets until dawn, phone vain men, go<br />
To meetings, marches, grim, unled. So we<br />
Shall win; and shall be spat at in the streets.</p>

<h4>Poetics</h4>
<p>Aristotle, who once taught a boy<br />
Who would waste many cities<br />
Came late to poetry’s burnt Troy.<br />
<br />
Alexander drilled crack troops. O see<br />
That epic, flute, share one clear goal:<br />
They imitate reality.<br />
<br />
Reversals which unloose the knot<br />
Are good. The trumpet sounds. The weak<br />
May yet succeed, with a strong plot.<br />
<br />
No army ever marched so far.<br />
It helps a writer to be mad.<br />
But then we have hamartia,<br />
<br />
The choice, the faults which will lead up<br />
To all that follows. Hush the drum.<br />
What slides in Alexander’s cup?<br />
<br />
Guilt purges, Christians thought. But fact<br />
Will do, the Greeks wrote, one clear act.<br />
Drama’s what’s done, the old man cried.<br />
Lips cracked to black, the young King died.</p>

<h4>At Eight</h4>

<p>The kittens are out! They are dizzy with sky.<br />
Pavements, wet drives, neighbours’ smooth grass<br />
Melt to their paws, twin racehorses<br />
In Saturday’s calm, before shopping or cars.<br />
They twist, they fly, swim sun and I<br />
Trespass, stumble, flag down first cars.<br />
<br />
Snatch one, the quick tabby! Scoop her up. Look,<br />
Here is the back grass, sheltered and safe,<br />
Stay here. (She wriggles.) The squirrel! Look.<br />
Across the dazzle, great glistening eyes<br />
Meet, before years of ambush: lock.<br />
Now she is off, to the shadow of wings,<br />
The ringdove, the robin, the delicate wren,<br />
Dead nettle stalks, ivy, steep railway banks.<br />
Roused from warm screens by their skiddings and squeak,<br />
My neighbour’s frail son tugs the curtain back, looks:<br />
The kittens are out. It is Christmas week.</p>

<h4>Rosie</h4>
<p>You block the slope, chestnut and truculent.<br />
When you came, a gangling two year old,<br />
you spotted me at once.<br />
My muddy coat was rich with mints;<br />
heart, with foolish love of horses.<br />
<br />
My own horse hated you,<br />
since you were turned out with the foal,<br />
her foster-child. You were her distant cousin.<br />
At twenty-two, she spotted her young rival,<br />
without her fine socks; with a pale blonde mane<br />

<br /><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; MARGIN-LEFT: 3px; MARGIN-RIGHT: -6px" height="417" alt="" src="../images/rosie179_p.jpg" width="170" align="right" border="0" />which, grazing, combed moon daisies, effortless.<br />
How the old hate the young. How the young pine.<br />
Once you pawed the wire fence, hooked your front shoe,<br />
yet hurtled over, unhurt, my true cob.<br />
I should have bobbed through April’s woods on you,<br />
have bolted in the blurring stubble field,<br />
sweated, cursed, forgot. Horses are love,<br />
<br />
but love is for the young and I am old<br />
the right hip’s stabbing held at bay by pills<br />
the ruined shoulder subtle as a bruise.<br />
My old mare, curled beside the water trough,<br />
sleeps, like a warm dog. How did you make<br />
scuffs on your polished forehead? Still half-broken,<br />
you have been advertised. You are for sale.<br />
This is your chance.<br />
<br />
We smell the mints’ perfume<br />
blow from my pocket. The tiny crescent moon<br />
rides on your shoulder. The deer stir in the woods,<br />
the swifts surge higher. But I take my course<br />
down the rough grasses, in the heat’s last haze.<br />
You are not my horse.</p>
