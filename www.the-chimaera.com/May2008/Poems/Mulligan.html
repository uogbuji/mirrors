		<h4>Bears Eat Monkey in Front of Zoo Visitors</h4>
<p>(news headline)</p>
<p>
Nature is sometimes a little too close to us,<br />
not picturesque and cute, nor crude but barred<br />
from showing us the true carnivorous<br />
tearing of flesh whose shrieking can be heard<br />
above the nearby traffic and the songs<br />
of cotton-candy thinness floating from<br />
pavilions where the burgers and foot-longs<br />
are sanitary, though the greasy gleam<br />
is like the rosy shine of living blood<br />
suddenly blooming in the afternoon<br />
beneath the birds that squawk, scatter and hide<br />
and silver indifference of a passing plane.<br />
So strain to watch, or flinch and turn, but see<br />
in meal and eater: meat is our destiny.<br /></p>


<h4><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 12px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="318" alt="" src="../images/snake190.jpg" width="190" align="right" border="0" />fall of the serpent</h4>
<p>
The serpent writes in the book of the leaves,<br />
snakeskin pages of the fall, its slow story:<br />
how the invisible, like a wind within the body,<br />
a breath beneath the air the lung-bellows heaves<br />
into and out of itself, can move whatever lives<br />
to freeze at the rustle, the taut skin uneasily<br />
surrounding the clenched heart, the slick, queasy<br />
terror that coils over and squeezes what it loves<br />
while the snake glides by, its erotic tongue<br />
probing the worldly scents, tenderly and quick<br />
in its attentions, cherishing the various tastes,<br />
each for its own moment, along the long<br />
journey through untold stories to a dark<br />
suddenness, to the last fall of all bright beasts.<br /></p>

<h4>Quartet for the End of Time</h4>
<p>
<span style="COLOR: white">************&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***</span>i<br />
<br />
Dark messianic impulse — where does it lead?<br />
The clock, the cinder track, all end and start<br />
and go on. Young women turn to dust and bleed,<br />
and clench and open like a pumping heart,<br />
<br />
then people hurtle through the flaming sky<br />
to vanish, leaving shadows in a pose<br />
of daily life uncoiling endlessly,<br />
a frieze of figures on an antique vase.<br />
<br />
It shatters. Shards are placed and pasted down,<br />
blank spaces filled, a new mosaic made<br />
of parts of an older art, a vision drawn<br />
to grunted music, daubed with drying blood<br />
<br />
and prancing on a stage. New wreckage breaks<br />
apart on rocks, in waves — the spurt and spew<br />
fall on us all, as we cling to old mistakes.<br />
I cannot even hear what I call to you.<br />
<br />
<span style="COLOR: white">**************&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span>ii<br />
<br />
The Thought Police on both sides of the street<br />
patrol in tailored suit and tired smile,<br />
politely urging up and down the beat<br />
a bent receptiveness, and all the while<br />
<br />
the clock grows louder, faster, like a plane<br />
approaching; horns and whistles wait. The breath<br />
releases slowly, or the shadows stain<br />
the standing wall and swollen clouds unearth<br />
<br />
the hidden beast.Survivors pick and choose<br />
appropriate descriptions of the day<br />
in growing chorus; words blur as they fuse<br />
to growl or whimper, which bright teeth relay<br />
<br />
as crisp, enunciated morsels to<br />
a shocked and eager horde of customers.<br />
Exhausted arms sift rubble, find a few<br />
remains extractable from cooling embers.<br />
<br />
<span style="COLOR: white">**************&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *</span>iii<br />
<br />
The seeds explode in hot erupting fields<br />
of shattered fruit. The pump at the poisoned well<br />
oozes a mucous yellow sludge, which yields<br />
aroma of damnation. Rotted swill<br />
<br />
bubbles in wooden bowls, garnished with flies.<br />
The children’s eyes are screams of common prayer.<br />
Response comes, thunder from the flowering skies<br />
and gently drifts, and gathers everywhere.<br />
<br />
Belief in our abandonment is sure:<br />
deliverance is voiding, excrement<br />
that beetles roll in bundled, grainy spheres.<br />
Home is a rubbled wall, the veil is rent<br />
<br />
exposing the bony harlot’s lunar face,<br />
the cave-mouth calling, and the echoing howl<br />
from among the bone-mounds of a hungry voice<br />
calling down appetite upon us all.<br />
<br /><span style="COLOR: white">***************&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> iv<br />
<br />
New grasses stab through stubble. Asphalt cracks<br />
and weed-beaks poke into a dusty breeze.<br />
Infected mounds of shoreline foam attract<br />
small hoverers, which tendrils stalk and seize.<br />
<br />
Persistent, casual pollen floats across<br />
the flowing corn, and birds like bright fish dart<br />
and swerve, then disappear. A mottled face<br />
ripens in underbrush, stone eyes alert.<br />
<br />
The painted hills unload their bounteous haul<br />
as sterile boxes sink into the mud.<br />
The fire-creatures echo animal-call.<br />
The trap awaits anointment with fresh blood.<br />
<br />
The snow of years has gathered. Barren white<br />
stretches beneath the emptied moon. Along<br />
the mountain-crest, harsh voices ring the night<br />
with prayer and imprecation, animal song.</p>
