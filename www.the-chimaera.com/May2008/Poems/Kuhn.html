		<h4>Utica Sestina</h4>
<p>A long-boned gliding boy in rain. He’d run<br />
in any weather deep into the fall<br />
in hail sometimes around the river’s bend<br />
alone beneath the tall green drugstore clock<br />
so lightly passing that he seemed a trick<br />
of vision in the window of each empty store<br />
<br />
and when he’d pass the whitewashed grocery store<br />
his father many years had tried to run<br />
he did not tense or vary pace or fall<br />
behind the others in his mind or bend<br />
the facts he knew or glance up at the clock<br />
but ticked along and picked the miles up trick<br />
<br />
by trick the way his father with the trick<br />
knee used to do when business at the store<br />
got slow and no-count pals of his who’d run<br />
up tabs with him they’d never pay would ‘fall<br />
by’ as they put it just to sagely bend<br />
themselves to cards beneath the broken clock<br />
<br />
some beer distributor had left — a clock<br />
that told no time yet still displayed the trick<br />
lights of a city river nightscape. Store<br />
the memory away and neither run<br />
away nor towards what cannot change but fall<br />
in with the rhythm of what’s coming. Bend<br />
<br />
yourself to what you could not ever bend,<br />
yourself — the world that briskly cleaned the clock<br />
of guileless guys like his nice no-trick<br />
pony of a dad who knew what was in store<br />
yet could not either make a stand or run<br />
away but chose instead to merely fall<br />
<br />
in place so that his one son saw him fall<br />
for years yet never break but only bend<br />
as if his dumb defiance of the clock<br />
that ticked out “life is elsewhere” did the trick<br />
and meant it wasn’t so and that his store<br />
of hope and energy would never run<br />
<br />
out, until it did. The son took the clock,<br />
locked the store, did not run the river’s bend<br />
but walked. It was no small trick not to fall.<br /></p>

		<div class="endnote">
		Andy Kuhn’s first serious brush with poetry came in a seminar with Mark Strand in 1970 or so. More recently he did a workshop with Ron Padgett. He has been a journalist, a jobber in firewood, and for the last fifteen years a psychologist. He lives in the New York area and writes furiously while trying also to enjoy life.
