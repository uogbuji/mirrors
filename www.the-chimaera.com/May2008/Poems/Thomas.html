		<h4>Cows in a Corofin Field</h4>
<p>(County Clare)</p>


<p>And so they stand,<br />
heads up, spines bevelled.<br />
They face their own<br />
intimate ways,<br />
as though each jaw<br />
stripped and cudded<br />
the green of a compass-point.<br />
Clouds bag down low<br />
about their shanks —<br />
swatches of restless water<br />
to shammy off<br />
the ticks and shit<br />
and meadow-smears<br />
of another week<br />
misted in dreams.</p>
<p>Suddenly<br />
they wheel around,<br />
as at a single click<br />
up or down<br />
in the humour of the air;<br />
lock into the path<br />
of a leader<br />
who pioneers her way<br />
to the edge of their world,<br />
the cut of her legs<br />
like a horse in show,<br />
her tail a self-maddening crop.</p>
<p>Perhaps she has scented<br />
a hogsback of grass<br />
that hunkered itself<br />
in the long caprices of summer.<br />
Or autumn has her already<br />
by the nose<br />
and draws her on<br />
to its wilds of perpetual half-light,<br />
where shelter<br />
is the pitch of undefending struts<br />
in a matchstick universe,<br />
where Novembers capitulate<br />
in javelins of rain
on shaken eaves.</p>

<h4>Never A Bone Between Them</h4>
<p>Do they know their boy<br />
is up at his window,<br />
high where the air<br />
misremembers the feathering of larks<br />
and first stars<br />
find each other shyly<br />
with their horns of antique light?</p>
<p>Do they hear the town strike nine?<br />
See the September day<br />
fall itself apart,<br />
hand over its narrows of blue,<br />
the crackle of a leaf new-dead<br />
in a flowing tree?</p>
<p>Their boy frets and squeezes<br />
against the pane. Makes a passing feint<br />
at the catch, as if giving<br />
a lollopy wave<br />
to his purseful of words and summers.</p>
<p>Do they know that,<br />
held for now on the sill’s twigging,<br />
the thin cuppage of glass,<br />
adventure makes his eyes<br />
wetly beautiful?</p>
<p>
Tails of spent comets glide<br />
from one to the other, the vapour-fleece<br />
of unbuildable jets.<br />
All the come-hither of space works upon him.<br />
Words with never a bone between them<br />
twangle his heart. Boing. Kerpow. Splat.</p>
<p>Below, a bus strikes a can.<br />
It ballerinas sleepily to rest where it meant.<br />
A wrapper fights lamp and rail<br />
yet homes like kite-silk to its pavestone.</p>
<p>Do they know his hand and the catch<br />
are of a length?</p>
<p>He is blessed, being rubber,<br />
being boots that crunch flame and calamity<br />
and keep their sheen.<br />
He clamps a harness of speedlines<br />
to his back. The wind writes <em>whoosh</em><br />
up the frames and bricking,<br />
knuckles his mouth,<br />
cries it again in his soul.</p>
