		<p><em>Dissonances</em>.  Nigel McLoughlin, Bluechrome £12.99</p>
<div class="just">
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">T</span>his book caught me off-guard and quickly became one of my favourite collections of the year. I expected a volume called <em>Dissonances</em> would be ultra-clever, perhaps well-crafted but ultimately cold. It is both clever and well-crafted but far from cold. This book is alive with love poems, especially to the poet’s children and his father, but also to the world itself: “lightning strikes a tree/with all the love one jagged thing/can muster for another.”</p>
<p>
“Love will find its own balance”seems to be at the heart of this work. He succeeds in describing the things which are so hard to shape, and does so with perfect clarity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the great bell of the world vibrates and I am drunk<br />
with winter-shine. The concrete blazes. The red tang<br />
of seven o’clock and the vein-belt of walking brazen<br />
to the frost leaps through me. An hour before petrol-stink<br />
and the shrink of people diminishing into a rush, here<br />
in the open-throated song of morning, I am in the clear.</p></blockquote>
<p>These poems have a real music built into their bones, and are fleshed with sharp imagery, the sort that makes you say, “Yes, that’s how it is”:
“My chest is cold as the bow of a boat”, “a face like a bolted door”: they form a tangible, sensory connection between the poet and the world — a physicality which he appears to transmit effortlessly to the reader.</p>
<p>McLoughlin is a poet in love with language. I enjoyed the breadth of his vocabulary (had to look up <em>etiolated</em>, <em>phreatic</em>, <em>xebec</em>) and the way he uses Irish words to spice up the English.<img class="pullquote_right" height="105" alt="If this had been a soft-back it would have been much defaced with turned-down pages but I couldn’t bear to do it with this book." src="../images/pq_butt.gif" width="204" align="right" border="0" />He is a word-scavenger, gathering whatever will sound right: “there in/ semi-darkness we’ll cugger and eat in secret”, “The first knuckles swell and harden, but do not thole long”, “a small pawnger-full of wine.”</p>
<p>Although the book is divided into four sections, there are three distinctively different types of poems here: his own, often personal, usually free-verse lyrics of the first two sections; the experimental “exploded forms” of the Shrapnel section, which have the effect of making the reader pause and savour each word or phrase, and acknowledge that every one is there because it has to be; and thirdly the masterly translations of the Second Sight section.  This begins and ends with translations of Rilke verses, which sandwich eight wonderful Irish poems, and the inclusion of these make it clear where his poetic roots lie. The depth of feeling, and rightness of imagery, and musicality of the translations from Cathal O Searcaigh, Sean O Tuama, Mairtin O Direain, and Sean O Riordain is at the heart of his own poems too. McLoughlin fits here as part of a rich tradition and culture. The musical qualities of his own poems are based on old Gaelic metrical devices and on a Gaelic sound system related to assonance, consonance, dissonance, and continued through work in modern Irish and the Hiberno-English dialect.</p>
<p>So, back to the book’s title, which I had read in its colloquial rather than literary meaning (OED: “discordant, harsh-toned, incongruous”) and found so at odds with the contents.  The poet explains that the title relates to a number of different dissonances: “first the use of dissonant rhymes (where closely related consonants and vowels are played off each other to give the musical effect of a slightly bum note) — e.g. d, t, th, dth sounds being used for consonantal dissonances. The other dissonances are the relation of the binding effect of the musical quality of the verse and its tension with the ‘formal looseness’ or with ‘exploded form’ — many of the poems in that section began life as sonnets (perhaps they still are a form of ‘exploded sonnet’). Then there are certain dissonances between the subject matter of the poems and the imagery used to explore the subject.” So there we have it!</p>
<p>I usually have a nasty habit of turning down the pages of poetry books so I can find the poems I like more easily. If this had been a soft-back it would have been much defaced with turned-down pages but I couldn’t bear to do it with this book. Congratulations to Bluechrome for publishing hardback collections. This is what slim volumes of poems should feel like. And these are the kind of poems they should contain. I was grateful to find nothing harsh-toned or discordant in this collection. Rather I found harmony, light, clarity, craftsmanship, intelligence and love:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Seanduine</strong><br />
(for Euan)</p>
<p>I soften for you. Your toddle<br />
and “how do” short-legging it<br />
along the path, conniving<br />
to be last in line, hands<br />
clenched behind your back<br />
or relaxed into a wrist-<br />
and-kidney strut, you come<br />
with a reverse kiss,<br />
the da-da da-da syntax<br />
urgent with no words.<br />
Your head and heart are full<br />
of the things you can’t say yet.<br />
You contrive. You mean like hell.<br />
And so do I. And so do I.</p>
</blockquote>
