<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">I</span> hadn’t spoken to Ray Pospisil in months, not since he rang me, elated that his manuscript of poetry had been accepted by a Dublin publisher. There were a couple of e-mail exchanges after that, and then, on a cold, clear January day here in Galway, I got word that Ray had died in Brooklyn, a casualty of a long struggle with depression and booze. I managed to get through the work day somehow, headed home, and spent the evening pondering the loss.</p>
<p>I knew Ray through the New York City poetry “circuit”, that network of participants in the readings that take place across the city. I first met him in the spring of 2005 at a reading in the East Village of New York City.<img class="pullquote_left" height="108" alt="His were poems that could stare into that inner darkness, when the streets are mostly empty and everyone else is asleep, and call despair by its true name." src="../../images/pq_lehr.gif" width="200" align="left" border="0" />It was clear, from the first time I heard him recite his work, that he was a poet of uncommon ability and expressiveness. His were poems that could stare into that inner darkness, when the streets are mostly empty and everyone else is asleep, and call despair by its true name. It is not the sort of poetry that is easy to get into magazines — though Ray did rack up some publication credits — but it was a poetry that was harrowing but moving, possessed of humour, tenderness, and that aching sense of a beauty that you can only experience occasionally, or at a distance, or in memory.</p>
<p>Ray’s poems were the poems of an intensely private man, a man who was often alone with his thoughts and memories, in whose work genuine interaction with others — friendship, family, romance — was a fragile thing, a counterpoint to the loneliness of the city, to a working life spent in front of a computer screen, and to the many insomniac nights of soul-searching that feature so prominently in Ray’s poetry. His work was not always palatable, and the comfort within it was hard-earned.  There was never much in the way of bullshit in Ray’s poetry. In “Ghost in the House”, Ray wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate when folks<br />
refer to “The events of 9/11.”<br />
Events? As if the murdered people sat<br />
around some playing field in baseball caps<br />
and fanned themselves with programs for the day’s<br />
unfolding schedule. He is not deceased,<br />
which means he simply upped and went away,<br />
because he didn’t like the food, perhaps.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ray is not deceased. He has not “passed on”. He is dead. American poetry has lost one of its best poets, and there was no commemoration of this at an AWP conference; there were no remarks in the pages of the <em>New Yorker</em> or the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em>. No statue went up to join Shakespeare and Robert Burns, and... ummm… Fitz-Greene Halleck on the Literary Walk in Central Park. The world went about its business.</p>
<p>I often wondered why Ray’s work wasn’t snapped up by the journals. The acceptances accreted slowly, and not for want of effort on his part. While Ray could manage a trope as well as anyone, he used his prosodic skill as a means of driving the point home to the reader, not as a means of sublimating a poem’s <em>raison d’etre</em>. He did not indulge in the frequent New Formalist fallacy that states that a poem’s worth is based on its technical perfection. The technical perfection was there to <em>hone and focus the underlying honesty, and indeed, profundity of the work</em>, which could result in a poetry that was uncomfortable but ultimately more satisfying than the decorousness too many editors seem to prefer in poems.</p>

<p>But that’s often how it happens, and, really, needn’t detain us. Nor should the poems that won’t now be written. We have the poems that <em>were</em> written, the poems that appeared in Ray’s chapbook, <em>Some Time Before the Bell</em>, the poems in his forthcoming collection, as well as the poems he read week after week, to small audiences in bars, theatres, and libraries across New York City. These poems were the work of a man who lived <em>his</em> life — not the life we might wish he had lived — a life in which love often proved elusive, in which all of the stupidity and petty cruelty and fucking indifference of the world in which we find ourselves weighed heavily.</p>
<p>And it’s our world, too, whether we seek to deny it, chop it into small, digestible driblets of McPoems, or just close our eyes to it. Ray, for whatever reason, did not, and it consumed him, leaving only his apotheosis, the poems that will, years from now, haunt those who come into contact with them. And they, <em>we</em>, remember him. We always will, and, through his work, so should you.</p>

<p>I wish I could say Ray’s death surprised me more than it did. The story was a familiar one. The drinking, then the withdrawal from the world outside his flat, and then... There had always been the last-minute save before. New York poet friends (and, as I have since discovered, others) managed to intervene, to get him to the hospital, and there would be another period of sobriety. And there would be poems, and even after the poet is gone, the poems remain.</p>

<h4>POEMS BY RAY POSPISIL<br /></h4>
<h5>Ghost in the House</h5>
<p>When I was growing up, we had a ghost<br />
which hovered over us. It hovered there<br />
without a shape at suppertime, when talk<br />
was on our schoolwork, how the yard needs more</p>
<p>attention, or the neighbours’ gossip, car<br />

concerns and sneaker prices. Everyone<br />
could feel the ghost but no one said a word.<br />
He was “deceased,” my mother used to say</p>
<p>or “passed away.” She took us to the grave<br />
and she complained about the lack of care<br />
for grass around the stone. They never mow,<br />

despite the contract, and the grass grew up</p>
<p>so high that you could barely read the name.<br />
So we would stand there for a while, but she<br />
would never tell a story, much less tell<br />
us how she felt about him, how they had</p>
<p>some happy times. I never saw her cry<br />
unless she saved that weak indulgence for<br />
the private times she locked herself inside<br />
her room and played her vinyl disks for hours.</p>

<p>I guess those were their favourite tunes, the ones<br />
they may have danced to at the time they met.<br />
She never said. I never asked. And now<br />
she’s gone. I’ll never know. She passed away.</p>
<p>A grim, respectful photo on the wall,<br />
but not so big to hint at sentiment,<br />
reminded us the ghost once had a form.<br />
And if a visitor inquired, he was</p>

<p>identified as “late,” as in “the boys’<br />
late father,” now deceased, or not alive,<br />
no longer living, passed away. The man<br />
was in a plane that hit another plane</p>
<p>in some flash storm above the Andes, crashed<br />
into a mountainside, where tribesmen stripped<br />

his clothes and shoes off, yanked out all his teeth<br />
to pry the silver from the fillings there,</p>
<p>and cut his goddamn finger off to get<br />
the golden wedding ring. Deceased? It robs<br />
the man of dignity to desiccate<br />
his death with tidy words.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate when folks<br />
refer to “The events of 9/11.”<br />
Events? As if the murdered people sat<br />
around some playing field in baseball caps</p>
<p>and fanned themselves with programs for the day’s<br />
unfolding schedule. He is not deceased,<br />
which means he simply upped and went away,<br />
because he didn’t like the food, perhaps.</p>
<p>Of course she never told us how she got<br />
the news. A call? Or did the company<br />

dispatch a representative. She may<br />
have seen a car pull up and wonder why</p>
<p>a man in such a business suit had come<br />
to ring her doorbell while her husband was<br />
away. If he’d been missing for a while,<br />
she must have sensed what news had come. I wish</p>
<p>I’d heard her tell the story. And of course<br />
she never told us how she felt that day<br />

or if she missed him later on. But he<br />
became a ghost and hovered over us</p>
<p>without a form. She never told us how<br />
she felt. I never asked. And now she’s gone.<br /></p>

<h5>Insomnia</h5>
<p>Some radios on call-in stations buzzed<br />
and crackled underneath my bed at night,<br />
preventing me from sleeping. As I tossed<br />

to find a posture that would shut them out<br />
and let me sleep at least an hour, the buzz<br />
began congealing into words I heard.<br />
But all the voices ranted on their harsh<br />
obsessive paths of snide hysteria,<br />
contemptuously barking down the ones<br />
who called. And gradually they harmonised<br />
till everyone was talking all the same,<br />
but throwing echoes like you get around<br />

a baseball park when radios throughout<br />
the stands all blare the same announcer’s voice,<br />
announcer’s voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with just a slight delay<br />
<em>a slight delay</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from those that stretch out through<br />

the distance,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;through the distance</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the packed<br />
and restless crowd. I gripped the sheets, and as<br />
the voices came together they emerged<br />
from underneath my bed as holograms<br />
of heads that rose above me. They were stern<br />
and never blinked. They hung there silently.<br />

And then one spoke, repeated by the rest<br />
in staggered sequence like the rounds in songs<br />
for kids. “You will succeed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>You will succeed</em><br />
in crushing spirits,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; crushing spirits.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those<br />

around you will be damaged by your good<br />
intentions,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>good intentions</em>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; just the way<br />
it’s always been,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it’s always been<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; your good<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <em>you can bring<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; after years of work<br />
and struggle, will indeed come true,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; indeed<br />
come true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by years of work and struggle.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But<br />
the dreams will turn to what you’re suffering now<br />
though ten times worse than this,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>you’re suffering now<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You’ll feel you’ve chased a dim<br />
elusive ghost and when you finally grasp<br />
a hold, it burns like steam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>elusive ghost,</em><br />
and when you finally grasp a hold it burns<br />
and dissipates,<br /><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;elusive ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</em> it burns<br />
like steam,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; elusive ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and dissipates<br />
in air.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will be lonely growing old<br />
but you will always have consoling hope<br />
of true self-realisation<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>growing old</em><br />
you will be lonely with consoling hope<br />
of true self-realisation in a bleached,<br />
locked ward<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>creating realisation in<br />
a bleached, locked ward</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creating moccasins.”</p>
<p>The first head stopped and licked its lips as all<br />
the other heads’ cascading echoes closed<br />

that final cadence, one by one, and fell<br />
to silence, hissing on the “moccasins”.</p>
<p>I thought the heads would fade and let me sleep,<br />
but they continued pulsing, shimmering<br />
reflections of the green electric glow<br />
my bedside clock emitted — 3:09.<br />
And then the first head spoke again: “There is<br />

a way for you to show some courage now,<br />
to compensate for all the harm and all<br />
the disappointment your pathetic deeds<br />
of goodness have inflicted on the world.<br />
It’s in your hands to leave the world a kind<br />
of legacy”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;— and all the other heads<br />
joined in —<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Your absence.”<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Then the first one spoke<br />
alone. “Bequeath your absence, which will carve<br />
a space for light where only shadow looms.”<br />
I started getting up but then he spoke<br />
again. “Be grateful for the shit you’ll miss:<br />
the riots over gasoline, the floods<br />

from polar ice caps melting, wars and bombs,<br />
and mobs arousing people from their beds<br />
at night for quick tribunals, marched away<br />
for execution, confiscating hearts<br />
and eyes and kidneys for the auction trade.<br />
Be glad you’ll miss it, count your blessings.” All<br />
the other heads agreed and nodded “yes”<br />

in unison.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; “You’ve got a chance to grab<br />
your fate, so be pro-active, close the deal,<br />
and never let them say again you lacked<br />
the traits of character that leaders show.”</p>
<p>I leaped up from the bed and threw a punch<br />
but all the heads dispersed in glowing smoke.<br />
I did a hundred jumping jacks and drank<br />

a couple beers, a shot of vodka, then<br />
another till my nerves began to calm,<br />
until my nerves began to calm.<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shot<br />
of vodka till my nerves relaxed.</em>
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I tried<br />
to mute the echoes with a cable show<br />
on offshore drilling,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; drilling through the sea<br />

to punch a hole into the crust of earth.<br />
I wondered why the ocean doesn’t all<br />
run down the hole into the molten core<br />
and turn to steam, and rise up through the cracks<br />
in streets and cellar floors. We’ll heat our homes<br />
while cars with little vacuum cleaners suck<br />
it up to move their pistons. Power plants<br />
could draw it through their turbine blades to spin<br />

all day. We’ll never have to drill again.<br />
We’ll never have to drill a rolling sea<br />
arrayed before the light when everyone<br />
is warm and all the wars have ended, all<br />
the pretty sea is warm and all the fish<br />
are thriving, and we never have to drill<br />
again while everyone is warm and all<br />
the fish arrayed before us shine, and all<br />

the turbines turn and all the cars run on<br />
in silence through the pretty sea where all<br />
the fish are rolling and the wars are done.</p>

<h5>Uncle at Rest</h5>
<p>My uncle gripped a cigarette between<br />
his thumb and finger, let it hang down by<br />
his side. He never waved it all around<br />
between two fingers. When he drew a puff,<br />
<br />
his cheeks both caved, and rising smoke would make<br />
him squint one eye a bit. He took a drink<br />
of beer while holding down a drag, and then<br />
exhaled, directing all the smoke up high.</p>
<p>My uncle loved that beach town during spring<br />
when he was shaping up the bungalows<br />
for summer renters. Always wore the same<br />
old khaki pants with years of speckled paint<br />
and flannel shirt. He’d work a couple hours<br />
<br />
then he’d take a break to rock that wicker chair<br />
and drink a beer. The air was cool in spring,<br />
and salty. There were hardly any cars<br />
around, just owners fixing up their shacks,<br />
and lots of seagulls. Waves crashed on the beach.</p>
<p>My uncle took a drink of beer and rubbed<br />
a spotted, hairy hand across his eyes<br />
then slapped his thigh. “I love this goddamn place,”<br />
he said, and took another deep inhale.<br /></p>
