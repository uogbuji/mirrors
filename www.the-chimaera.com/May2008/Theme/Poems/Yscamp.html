		<h4>Letter</h4>
<p>This letter’s best dress is rain,<br />
I write you. An unapologetic<br />
downpour drums the zinc roof<br />
so nothing can vanish.<br />
Everything finds its way<br />
onto this sprouting balcony,<br />
into my strained grammar.</p>
<p>If you get my drift, I write,<br />
some continental changes<br />
occur particle by particle.</p>
<p>This close to the equator<br />
the habit is to leave a part of yourself<br />
at the houses where you’ve been treated<br />
graciously, a finger, a lash, a full suit</p>
<p>of skin. If your reception was sour,<br />
it’s common to pack<br />
right in front of your host,<br />
taking what’s yours, as well as all the family<br />
portraits hung on the walls<br />
and those of family members out of favor,<br />
stashed away in bureau drawers.</p>
<p>Refused entry, wave a dollar, create<br />
a misunderstanding, sulk like a brat.<br />
Needless to say, it’s tough making friends here;<br />
homicide would almost be easier.<br />
You see how I miss you?</p>
<p><img height="285" alt="" src="../../images/rain.jpg" width="380" border="0" /></p>
<h4>In This River Against Ownership</h4>
<p>I wanted to walk the river<br />
as far as it went but I didn’t.<br />
I was ten<br />
and heard my parents<br />
and came back. But my sneakers had filled<br />
with water slipping on the wet bed stones,<br />
getting somewhere. I was beginning to see<br />
the sorts of softer plants<br />
that grew beside, what collected<br />
in the eddies, the shape of gravity and melt,<br />
how the gully walls rose around the cleft.<br />
I saw where a corpse could lie for years while someone walked free.<br />
It was growing dark. I was running out of time, lost in the plot of water.<br />
At last I could speak aloud alone, ask<br />
who else had washed off what smell<br />
in this river against ownership?<br />
When their voices reached me with my given name,<br />
a baying on the air, I turned back and into myself,<br />
hurried back, so they wouldn’t find or claim me.<br /></p>
