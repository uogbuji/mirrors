		<h4>You Know</h4>
<p>You know what they said? They said<br />
People like you, they’re wrong in the head,<br />
People like you, they’d be better dead.<br />
Yes that’s what they said, you know.</p>
<p>You know what they did? What they did<br />
They messed with the brain of a nice little kid,<br />
He was nicer than you and he ran and hid.<br />
Still that’s what they did, you know...<br />
<br />
You know how they came? How they came<br />
Was a swish of smoke and a fizz of flame<br />
When the name of the game doesn’t stay the same.<br />
Say that’s how they came, you know...<br />
<br />
You know what it means?&nbsp; What it means<br />
Is it’s worse than the dreams of the magazines,<br />
Smashing your heart to smithereens<br />
See that’s what it means, you know.<br />
<br />
You know when they’ll go?&nbsp; When they’ll go<br />
Is when Lickety-split and that Old Jim Crow<br />
Both rattle the bones of Geronimo,<br />
So that’s when they’ll go, you know.</p>
<p>You know what I am? What I am<br />
Is the flim-flam man and not worth a damn,<br />
I’m not there at all, I’m a hologram.<br />
Yes that’s what I am, you know.</p>

<h4>Shakespearean Paradelle</h4>
<p class="smaller"><em>For Billy Collins who invented them and then pretended that he hadn’t</em></p>
<p>It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul<br />
It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul<br />
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars<br />
Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars<br />
You cause the cause my soul. It is the stars<br />
Let me name it to you.&nbsp; It is not chaste</p>
<p>The multitudinous seas incarnadine<br />
The multitudinous seas incarnadine<br />
Making the green one red<br />
Making the green one red<br />
Making the multitudinous red seas<br />
Incarnadine one green</p>
<p>Be not afraid. The isle is full of noises.<br />
Be not afraid. The isle is full of noises.<br />
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not<br />
Sounds and sweet airs that give delight and hurt not<br />
Be hurt not sweet, the full airs give delight<br />
That isle of sounds and noises, and is not afraid</p>
<p>Hurt not the name, chaste one, sweet you.<br />
Green soul, be it incarnadine,<br />
The cause is not afraid!<br />
It is not the stars, it is the full isle<br />
That multitudinous delight<br />
My seas, the sounds, noises, airs, me.<br /></p>

<h4>
Belonging</h4>
<p>
I have input; you must nit-pick; he invariably moans.<br />
I am svelte and slender; you are skinny; she’s a bag of bones.</p>
<p>I’m romantic; you’re a chaser: he is always on the job.<br />
I’m sophisticated; you’re a bit class-conscious; she’s a snob.</p>
<p>Ours is antique classic; yours is second-user; theirs is junk.<br />
I’m amusing and vivacious; you’re a chatterbox; she’s drunk.</p>
<p>I’m curvaceous; you’re full-figured; she’s disgustingly obese.<br />
We’ve been slandered; you’re quite dodgy; they’re all known to the police.</p>
<p>I’ve a theory; you’ve got views; he’s just a gambler with a hunch.<br />
I’m a poet; you’re a dreamer; she’s completely out to lunch.</p>
<p>I’m a bit abstracted; you’re forgetful; he’s amnesiac.<br />
I enjoy creative writing; you’re a journo; she’s a hack.</p>
<p>We respect tradition; you’re conservative; they’re from the ark.<br />
I use modern business methods; you’re go-getting; he’s a shark.</p>
<p>I like discipline; you’re stroppy; he gets mad and hits the kids.<br />
We require a fresh investment; you need cash; they’re on the skids.</p>
<p>I renounced the rat race; you’re between positions; he’s a loser.<br />
We unwind while you relax and they get plastered in the boozer.</p>
<p>I’m in crisis; you’ve had breakdowns, he’s gone off his bloody head.<br />
I gave up my fight with illness; you passed on; she croaked.&nbsp;<br />
<span style="COLOR: white">I gave up my fight with illness; you passed on; she croaked.</span> (We’re dead.)<br />

<h4>The Fairy Feller’s Master-Stroke</h4><p class="smaller"><em><img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 3px" height="377" alt="" src="../../images/fairy-feller.jpg" width="250" align="right" border="0" />Robert Dadd d. 1843.&nbsp; Richard Dadd d. 1886</em></p>
<p>You would<br />
Not want to be<br />
The dad of Richard Dadd.<br />
A sadder dad you’d never see!<br />
He died.</p>
<p>Dadd’s dad.<br />
The parricide,<br />
Bereft him of his life.<br />
<em>Up to the heft he plunged the knife</em>,<br />
Bad Dadd,</p>
<p>Mad son.<br />
He did for dad,<br />
And when the deed was done,<br />
The madhouse had him, mad, sad, bad,<br />
For good.</p>
