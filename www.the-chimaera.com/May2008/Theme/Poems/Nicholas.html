		<h4>Baking Greek Cookies</h4>
<p><img height="330" alt="" src="../../images/cookies330.jpg" width="330" border="0" /></p>
<p>My mother rolled the <em>koulourakia</em> softly,<br />
between the rough palms of her hands,<br />
kneading her two distinct lives.</p>
<p>Pushing gently, she formed her small island,<br />
then pressed more firmly as she worked<br />
her second life into shapes of larger States.</p>
<p>Even when she was a girl, so poor<br />
she made up games with a stick, a can,<br />
and a crippled cousin, she dreamed split worlds.</p>
<p>Things would be better over there —<br />
<em>it was America, for God’s sake</em> —<br />
and love along with fortune could be</p>
<p>discovered, or at least easily learned.<br />
My mother baked the <em>koulourakia</em> slowly,<br />
watched her dreams rise into one sweet twist.<br />
</p>

<h4>Shadow</h4>
<p class="smaller">— Sonnenizio based on a first line by James Wright</p>
<p>When I went out to kill myself, I caught<br />
my shadow in the hall mirror, outlined,<br />
frozen, like an animal who recognizes its killer<br />
and can’t decide when to make the first move.</p>
<p>Then I combed the yard, the garage, the pond<br />
behind the house, killing time until I could<br />
determine which method to use, which out<br />
I should take to avoid being caught, rescued.</p>
<p>When I tried to hang myself, I couldn’t tie.<br />
When I arched to asphyxiate myself, I breathed.<br />
When I dove in to drown myself, I was afraid<br />
and swam, caught between weakness and desire.</p>
<p>Last night, when I went out back to erase myself,<br />
I caught my shadow, allowed the killer to pass.<br /></p>

<h4>Wine</h4>
<p class="smaller">Don’t cry. Don’t cry... the wine of love — the wine of love intoxicated my soul.<br />
— Nikos Kazantzakis</p>

<p>Ripping through the cobblestoned streets, they tore<br />
through each other’s words, past the sleeping heart<br />
of the island, tossing off the leftover wine of excuses.</p>
<p>They wished someone might wave them in<br />
for Turkish coffee or sweet mastica to coat<br />
their distasteful quarrels, their tart make-ups.</p>
<p>Grabbing her hand behind the old church, he held it<br />
to him as they watched the baptismal ceremony. Drinking<br />
from a sheepskin, sour Retsina dripping down their necks,</p>
<p>she sobbed while he bleated the word <em>Signomi</em>,<br />
I’m sorry, pressed his hardness against her belly,<br />
against the space he had occupied the night before.<br /></p>
