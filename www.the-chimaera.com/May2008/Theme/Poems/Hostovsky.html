		<h4>Deaf Culture 101</h4>
<p><img height="450" alt="" src="../../images/deafculture440.jpg" width="440" border="0" /></p>
<p>In the deaf world, deaf<br />
is good. That’s the premise<br />
that sets the deaf world apart.<br />
So when the audiologist says<br />
to two deaf parents:<br />
“I’m sorry, your baby<br />

is profoundly deaf,” they do not<br />
weep or mourn or<br />
blame themselves or<br />
God. They rejoice.<br />
They embrace each other and even<br />
the confused audiologist who<br />
was the bearer of great<br />
tidings. Healthy deaf babies<br />

are good, the more the better!<br />
Deaf brothers, deaf sisters,<br />
deaf mothers and fathers<br />
confer considerable status<br />
in the deaf world. Ninety<br />

percent of all deaf people<br />
are born to families who hear —<br />
poor, benighted, hearing families<br />
who have never heard of the deaf world.<br />

That’s why deaf families<br />
are a kind of aristocracy<br />
where deaf is the currency.<br />
Deaf grandmothers and grandfathers,<br />
deaf aunts and uncles,<br />
deaf nieces and nephews and cousins and more<br />
deaf cousins. There are even<br />
some who are fourth or fifth<br />

or sixth generation deaf.<br />
These are the deaf royalty.<br />
Sometimes you can see them<br />
surrounded by dilating circles<br />
of envious, awestruck, deaf eyes<br />
just listening to the old stories<br />
told in elegant, flowing ASL —<br />
stories of vast family trees<br />
hearkening all the way back to the first<br />

deaf community on Martha’s Vineyard,<br />
or back to the first school for the deaf<br />
in Paris, France — to Laurent Clerc, and his teacher<br />
Jean Massieu, and his teacher<br />
the Abbe Sicard, who wasn’t deaf himself,<br />
but who nearly lost his head<br />
when the heads of the French aristocracy<br />

and clergy began to roll in the streets.<br />
But he didn’t lose his head, and it was only<br />
because the deaf of Paris loved him<br />
enough to write a letter<br />
to the Jacobins on his behalf,<br />
in elegant, flowing, flawless French,<br />
calling him their Father and their Teacher,<br />
and winning his release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Greenhouse</h4>
<p>My Aunt Ellie lived in a green-<br />
house. This was in Irvington<br />
New Jersey. A Jew alone<br />
is a Jew in danger, her husband<br />
said. Their daughter, my cousin,<br />
wanted to go where she wanted<br />
to go. They said it was a big<br />
mistake. In a greenhouse you<br />

cultivate certain delicate<br />
non-indigenous plants. The house<br />
was green and my cousin fell<br />
deeply in love with a black man.<br />
When she married him her father<br />
sat <em>shiva</em> for her, meaning that<br />
he mourned her for dead. But<br />
she was only living over in East<br />

Orange. She had two beautiful<br />
daughters, who never knew<br />
their grandfather on their mother’s<br />
side. Because she was dead to him<br />
until the day he died. That was the day<br />
we all went over to Aunt Ellie’s house<br />
where she was sitting <em>shiva. </em> We met<br />

my cousin’s husband Toe, for the first time,<br />
and their two daughters, Leah and Aleesha.<br />
And we opened all the windows in<br />
the greenhouse on that day, for outside<br />
it was a beautiful spring day and we<br />
broke out the expensive delicate china<br />
from Germany which they kept locked up<br />
in a glass breakfront in the hall.</p>



<h4>My Country Isn’t</h4>

<p>My country isn’t<br />
my country because<br />
I’m not myself.<br />
I haven’t been myself since<br />
I don’t know when.<br />
My mother said<br />
just be yourself.<br />

My father was<br />
himself all his life<br />
and everyone loved him.<br />
But I loved<br />
the smell of the rain<br />
before the rain<br />
more than the rain itself.<br />
And I lived<br />
in the country of<br />

myself all my life.<br />
The food was bad.<br />
The language odd.<br />
The peace unsteady.<br />
So I moved<br />
to the country of<br />
I’m not myself.<br />
To the country of<br />

I don’t know who<br />
and I don’t know what<br />
I am. And I am<br />
finally home.<br />
There always was<br />
that side of me.<br />
That is the side<br />
that I am on.<br />

I love my country.<br />
I will die for my country.<br />
But my country isn’t<br />
my country and I am<br />
not myself.</p>



<h4>Pigeon Lady</h4>
<p>“For me they are like the tide,”<br />
says the pigeon lady. And the thought<br />
that she’s keeping one inside
</p>
<p>comes to me. A rainbow-necked, red-eyed,<br />
pinioned pigeon weeps in her throat.<br />

“For me they are like the tide –</p>
<p>a thousand times I’ve tried<br />
to wet my fingers, to touch.<br />
But retreating, they keep inside</p>
<p>each other’s little struts, they nod<br />
and float away, nod and float<br />
away. For me they are like the tide.”</p>
<p>Behind her drizzling side-<br />

long frowns and crumbs the sun is out.<br />
The one she’s keeping inside</p>
<p>like a feather lodged, or tied<br />
in her blue-gray hair, it’s there. It can’t hide.<br />
“For me they are like the tide.”<br />
Cheeping, one’s inside.</p>

<h4>The Canes</h4>
<p>After the accident, he walked with a cane<br />
for several months. And he began to notice<br />

the other people with canes, and to feel<br />
a kinship with them, a strong identification<br />
when he saw one crossing a street or waiting<br />
for the train, the bus, the elevator — a desire<br />
to speak to them in the language of the cane,<br />
the language of the country of the cane,<br />
which no one else seemed to know existed,<br />
which he never knew existed himself until<br />

now. But he didn’t know what to say to them,<br />
because he didn’t know them. He only knew<br />
what they knew. So he didn’t say anything<br />
directly. But instead he said things to himself<br />
in the language that was in him. And his thoughts<br />
grew wider, as though the white canes of the blind<br />
were clearing the way — click, sweep, click –<br />

a separate way through the darkness home.</p>
