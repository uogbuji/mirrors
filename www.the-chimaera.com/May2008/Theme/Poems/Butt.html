		<h4>This Moment</h4>
<p>
Sunlight through leaves throws dappled shadows on the wall;<br />
the telephone sighs to rest&nbsp; in its cradle, shifts to get comfortable;<br />
fish defrosts on the work-top, drips pensively onto the plate;<br />
the&nbsp;cat turns, skirts an unseen obstacle, starts to wash its ears;<br />
I call a rushed good-bye while thinking of something else:<br />
the un-hung washing, un-paid bill, un-lived dream,<br />
the headlights which raked the ceiling of my childhood room.<br /></p>

<h4>
Ellis Island, New York</h4>
<p>
We grip the frozen handrail of the ferry,<br />
watch the waters churn their silver song.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The seagulls teach their young to ride<br />
the wind, hover at head-height, hoping<br />
&nbsp;<br />
for scraps, catching them in flight, tasting<br />
anticipation in this welcome-harbour’s air.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Now just us tourists, seeing once-removed<br />
through camera’s lens, knowing how memory<br />
&nbsp;<br />
can trick and lie. But every immigrant is here<br />
behind our eyes, dressed in their desperation<br />
&nbsp;<br />
and their optimism; watching the raised arm<br />
of liberty (her face the sculptor¹s mother’s ­<br />
&nbsp;<br />
who better to open the door to this new home?)<br />
They search the faces for a hint of those left behind:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
see how she flicks her hair, the set of his<br />
shoulders, tap of her fingers, curve of his head.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The boat hull bumps and tears at&nbsp; wooden piers<br />
of Ellis Island, they clutch the rails, fling<br />
&nbsp;<br />
their old life to the tide, climb gang-plank<br />
to a land which seems to roll and heave,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
lift ashore their bundled clothes and words<br />
the recipes and songs, tucking them close<br />
&nbsp;<br />
as gold coins sewn into the hems of petticoats<br />
wrapped with memories like an old woollen shawl.<br /></p>
<h4>
Travelling Fair</h4>
<p>
The shock of the impossible. It folds!<br />
That strident, swirling, screaming metal<br />
folds like obedient fabric, fitting lorry<br />
like a foot within a shoe. A carousel,<br />
a chair-swing, ghost-train, tunnel<br />
of love, each neatly telescoped<br />
onto the back of gaily painted truck;<br />
so memory folds and wraps the past<br />
its long and lovely pocketed moments.<br />
</p>
