<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">W</span>hen we thought of <em>Multum in parvo</em> as our Issue 4 Feature Theme, we congratulated ourselves on a cunning choice, one that would surely lighten our workload. But we failed to reckon with an apparently inexorable principle of the webzine universe — call it MacSpaunday’s Law of Compensatory Volume. That’s to say, while we were able to keep the M in P corpus appropriately slim (though certainly not slight), the bodies of the
other sections insisted on swelling accordingly. We were in the situation of a household in which one person is dieting and the other members of the family are therefore eating more of the choc-chip cookies.</p>
<p>Well, we <em>did</em> manage to be fairly ruthless in selecting the longer poems — only nine authors there. But the general section includes five substantial prose pieces, and the Spotlight Feature has grown and grown. The fact is that John Whitworth, our Spotlit poet this time, has numerous friends and admirers in the poetry world who were clamouring to have a say. We’re very grateful to them all for coming to this party, and of course to John Whitworth himself for the long and candid interview and the ten poems (mostly unpublished) he has supplied for the feature.</p>
