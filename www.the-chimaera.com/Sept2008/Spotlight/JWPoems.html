<h3>Rabbit Rabbit</h3>
<p class="smaller">
The Mekon is the stunted ruler of the evil empire in “Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future”.
&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>Learn to fossilize your rabbit.<br />
Learn to terminate your aunt.<br />
Can you see your chance and grab it?<br />
Can you kick a nasty habit?<br />
Is there anything you can’t?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>No. There’s no such word as can’t.</em></p>
<p>Learn to scale a Brecon Beacon.<br />
Learn to swim the Hellespont.<br />
Will you wilt and will you weaken?<br />
Will you overcome the Mekon?<br />
Is there anything you won’t?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Nothing that I won’t or don’t.</em></p>
<p>Learn to count those hours on hours,<br />
Eye to eye and hand in glove.<br />
Learn to storm the brazen towers.<br />
Can’t you see I’ve got the powers?<br />
Won’t you feel the power of Love?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What can you be thinking of?</p>
<p>Love is Sempiternal Zion,<br />
Love’s Cathedral lined with steel,<br />
Barred with Gates of Oak and Iron<br />
Where the Leopard and the Lion<br />
Interdict the Commonweal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Tell me what you truly feel.</em></p>
<p>Love has reasons and unreasons,<br />
Asks no questions, buts no buts,<br />
Tells no lies and acts no treasons.<br />
Love the lily, sweet in seasons,<br />
Shatters like a coconut<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>I can win this coconut.</em></p>
<p>What I feel is what I’m telling.<br />
What I tell is in my head.<br />
What I know is chanting, spelling<br />
From the loathly forest dwelling,<br />
From the House of Gingerbread.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>In your life and in your head.</em></p>
<p>Chanting, spelling, what I’m telling<br />
In my life and in my head,<br />
All the dolours of the dead.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Oh hear the dolours of the dead.</em></p>
<h3>The Difference</h3>
<p class="smaller">
The difference between men and women is like that between animals and plants. G.W.F. Hegel<br />
&nbsp;<br /></p>
<p>Free men are Kings of menand women are their Queens,<br />
It’s like poetry and daffodils, like sausages and beans,<br />
But, when two ride out together, then there’s one must ride behind,<br />
So, though Justice is a woman, she is blind, blind, blind.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Men want cars and football. Women want romance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are like animals. Women are like plants.</em></p>
<p>The King was in the counting house, counting out his money,<br />
The Queen was in the parlour, eating bread and honey.<br />
The money buys the honey but it buys a whole lot more<br />
For honey keeps a woman sweet and that’s what honey’s for.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Men want sex and alcohol. Women want to dance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are like animals. Women are like plants.</em></p>
<p>The King was on the battlefield directing all his battles.<br />
The Queen was at the big parade, parading all his chattels.<br />
The Queen was at the big parade applauding her applause:<br />
HURRAH-HURRAH-HURRAH for all the boys who win the wars.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Men want power and politics. Women want nuance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are like animals. Women are like plants.</em></p>
<p>The King was in the bedroom telling fortunes to the Queen:<br />
Big Men and Little Women that’s the way it’s always been.<br />
The Big Men get to organise the Little Women’s lives<br />
And machete-wielding persons kill their next-door neighbours’ wives.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Men are in the driving seat, women in a trance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are like animals. Women are like plants.</em></p>
<p>There’s history and herstory but they are not the same.<br />
When the man is up and doing then the woman gets the blame.<br />
She was poor but she was honest, victim of a rich man’s whim.<br />
When the in-laws make the outlaws then the outlook’s pretty grim.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Men want this and this and this. Women want a chance.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Men are like animals. Women are like plants.</em><br /></p>

<h3>More Quarks</h3>
<p>If Sasha were to come we could finish up the whisky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could play three-handed cribbage,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could cook a baked alaska,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if Sasha were to come, were to come, were to come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Sasha were to come right now.</em></p>
<p>If Sasha were to come we could telephone your mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could tiptoe through the tulips,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could learn progressive cricket,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could calibrate your rain gauge,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could modernise the system,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if Sasha were to come, were to come, were to come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Sasha were to come right now.</em></p>
<p>If Sasha were to come we could study Dostoevsky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could buy a red Ferrari,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could ravish seven virgins,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could hibernate till Easter,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could infiltrate masons,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could colonise the bastards,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could bandy random numbers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if Sasha were to come, were to come, were to come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Sasha were to come right now.<br /></em>
&nbsp;<br />
If Sasha were to come we could dance away our troubles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could modernise the penguin,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could save the bleeding planet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could calibrate your mother,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could bastardise the system<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could dominate the cricket,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could randomise the outcome,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could shimmy with the masons<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; we could finish up the whisky,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>if Sasha were to come, were to come, were to come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if Sasha were to come right now.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Four O’Clock</h3>
<p>The fat clock ticks and ticks and ticks and tells<br />
Me stuff I didn’t want to know I knew.<br />
Across a million billion windowsills<br />
The stellar dust is whispering of you.<br />
A Balkan website that I can’t access<br />
Texts messages to the Uranian rings.<br />
Since Tuesday last American Express<br />
Are threatening unimaginable things.<br />
A fairy child with an enormous head,<br />
A forky tail and huge, prehensile claws,<br />
Is swinging at the bottom of my bed<br />
And doesn’t seem to want to stay indoors.<br />
Call me. I’m waiting for your call.&nbsp;What’s done<br />
Is done. There’s nothing here for anyone.<br />
<br />
<br /></p>
<h3>Faith Zone</h3>
<p>We hurl the homosexuals from cliffs,<br />
Being enjoined to do so by religion<br />
That scours our souls of maybes and what ifs.<br />
Such wanton decadence is not our pigeon.<br />
The Word is firm and clear and unambiguous.<br />
Knowing and doing at every point contiguous.</p>
<p>We flog the godless traffickers in booze.<br />
We stone to death the vile adulteresses.<br />
Our sisters shall not marry where they choose,<br />
Nor flaunt themselves in lewd, immodest dresses.<br />
Such conduct is displeasing to the Lord<br />
Whose Truth is sharp and gleaming like a sword.</p>
<p>Forgive our carnal trespasses in youth.<br />
(Boys will be boys — we meant no harm at all.)<br />
That was before we heard the voice of Truth,<br />
That was before we answered to the call,<br />
That was before the blessed Scripture spoke<br />
And told us who to spare and who to croak.</p>
<p>The knife, the lash, the scaffold and the jail<br />
Prevent believers from behaving oddly.<br />
The Holy Word shall everywhere prevail.<br />
It drops from Heaven like manna to the godly.<br />
Our singleness of Faith is true security.<br />
Its flame shall burn in everlasting purity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>On the Deaths of Philosophers</h3>
<p class="smaller">
For Katie studying Philosophy<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Socrates</strong>, tried for corrupting young people, was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sentenced to death by the state.<br />
Giordano <strong>Bruno</strong> was burned by the Catholic<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Church — a most horrible fate!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Seneca</strong> stoically opened a vein when he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; finally quarrelled with Nero.<br />
<strong>Bonhoeffer</strong> said he was timid by nature, but<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; faced up to death like a hero.<br />
Viennese <strong>Schlick</strong> was shot dead by a mad Nazi<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; student whose thesis he ploughed.<br />
Pagan <strong>Hypatia</strong>, so learned and witty, got<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; stoned by a Christian crowd.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Yet, by and large, and it’s proven statistically,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; incontrovertibly<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; proven statistically<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; life does philosophers proud.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poor <strong>Gödel</strong> was fearful of poison and starved, having<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lived all his life rather prissily.<br />
<strong>Empedocles</strong>, much more intrepid, jumped into a<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; smoking volcano in Sicily.<br />
Gentle <strong>Pythagoras</strong> died in a fire, or a battle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; according to source.<br />
<strong>Whewell</strong>, the polymath Master of Trinity,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; died when he fell off his horse.<br />
Rational <strong>Condorcet</strong>, imprisoned by Robespierre, was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably killed in his cell.<br />
Atheist <strong>Lucretius</strong> (say Christians) took sex pills, went<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mad and lies burning in Hell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>But in the main you would have to admit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; when you’re faced with the evidence,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bound to admit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; most philosophers do very well.</em></p>
<p><strong>Shpet</strong>, the idealist phenomenologist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; perished through Stalinist thuggery.<br />
<strong>Montague</strong> died at the hands of a boy he<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; procured for the purpose of buggery<br />
<strong>Bacon</strong> caught cold stuffing snow in a chicken and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ended with scarcely a sniff.<br />
<strong>Jevons</strong> was drowned, and <strong>Protagoras</strong> shipwrecked..&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Herbrand</strong> fell off a cliff.<br />
<strong>More</strong> and <strong>Boethius</strong> took the king’s shilling and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; paid in the end with their heads.<br />
Giovanni <strong>Gentile</strong> who praised Mussolini was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; slaughtered by partisan Reds.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Still, for the most part, as might be expected,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in all probability<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be expected,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; philosophers die in their beds.</em></p>
<p></p>

<h3>The Egg</h3>
<p>Consider an enormous egg.<br />
It is, perhaps, an ostrich egg.<br />
Suppose it is an ostrich egg,<br />
The ostrich egg beneath your chair.<br />
(And what can it be doing there?)<br />
Suppose it smells. Suppose it swells.<br />
You’d like it better somewhere else.<br />
You’d like it better in the loft.<br />
(The egg is warm and strangely soft.)<br />
You’d like it better in the shed.<br />
(The egg is glowing strangely red.)<br />
You’d like it better in your head.<br />
It’s so much better in your head.<br />
You cross your heart and wish to die.<br />
(The egg begins to sough and sigh.)<br />
You wish that you could put it back.<br />
(The egg begins to gasp and crack.)<br />
You wish you had a telephone.<br />
(The egg begins to keen and moan.)<br />
You do not wish to be alone.<br />
You do not wish to be alone.<br />
You leave your chair.&nbsp; You leave the room.</p>
<p>The room is quiet as the tomb<br />
You listen quiet as a mouse.<br />
You leave the room.&nbsp; You leave the house.<br />
You vanish from the neighbourhood.<br />
You’d leave the country if you could.<br />
You know it isn’t any good.<br />
(The egg begins to sob and squall.)<br />
You know it isn’t any good.<br />
(The egg begins to caterwaul.)<br />
It isn’t any good at all.<br />
It isn’t any good at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Something Ugly<img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="375" alt="" src="../images/camel250.jpg" width="250" align="right" border="0" /></h3>
<p>Let me tell you of the camel<br />
How you ride him like a pony<br />
Though his hump is very lumpy<br />
And his back is very bony<br />
And his kick’ll send you sprawling<br />
And he spits like a howitzer<br />
And his hygiene is appalling25<br />
And his character, charisma<br />
And intelligence are dismal<br />
And his manners are abysmal,<br />
And his temper is infernal.<br />
So to put it in a nutshell,<br />
What in any other mammal<br />
Is unutterably awful,<br />
Is quite normal in the camel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Morocco Bound</h3>
<p class="smaller">
The last line of the chorus rightly belongs to Bing Crosby in “The Road to Morocco”.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re weirdy bards, we’re beardy bards, fine words are what we deal in.<br />
When poetry is on the cards and poems softly stealing,<br />
We winch them in with yards and yards of true poetic feeling.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We’re horrible and hairy, but our principles are sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, like Webster’s Dictionary, we’re Morocco bound.</em></p>
<p>We strike a pose, we strike a match, we light a lyric light.<br />
It’s like an itch you gotta scratch, you gotta get it right.<br />
It’s like a train you gotta catch, you gotta catch tonight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We might seem airy-fairy, but our feet are on the ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, like Webster’s Dictionary, we’re Morocco bound.</em></p>
<p>Some bards are miserable as sin and some are happy hunks.<br />
A few get rich as Rin Tin Tin but most stay poor as monks.<br />
A few will die of heroin, a lot will live as drunks.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We’re seriously scary but we’re seminally sound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, like Webster’s Dictionary, we’re Morocco bound.</em></p>
<p>Our Eastern star, our Shangri-La, it cancels out the curse,<br />
It nominates the fat cigar and writes the winning verse,<br />
It shows us where the good times are, for better or for worse.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>We’ve bought a dromedary and we paid a thousand pound<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, like Webster’s dictionary, we’re Morocco bound.</em></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Life at Eighty</h3><p class="smaller">This world of dew is but a world of dew. And yet. And yet.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; — Basho.</p>
<p>I like to loaf, I like to laugh; I like to read the <em>Telegraph</em>;<br />
I buy it at the student rate, it tells me of affairs of state;<br />
And on the state I meditate: I am a wise old fellow.</p>
<p>I potter in a world of prose; grandchildren tell me how it goes.<br />
They drink and disco at the club; I soak for hours in the tub,<br />
Careen my carcass, scrub-a-dub: I am a hale old fellow.</p>
<p>I mutter when I do not shout; in welly boots I splash about;<br />
I walk on rainy afternoons; I dine on cauliflower and prunes,<br />
And never mess my pantaloons: I am a clean old fellow</p>
<p>A television haruspex; I like the violence, hate the sex;<br />
I comb the Oxfam shops for togs; the country’s going to the dogs,<br />
I chart it all in monologues: I am a stern old fellow.</p>
<p>The doctor gives me coloured pills to cure me of my various ills,<br />
My smoker’s cough, my writer’s stoop, my lecher’s eye, my brewer’s droop,<br />
My belly like a cantaloupe: I am a sad old fellow.</p>
<p>A world of dew. And yet. And yet a world not easy to forget;<br />
I cannot let it pass me by; I stop and look it in the eye;<br />
And, as you see, I versify: I am a <em>game</em> old fellow.</p>
