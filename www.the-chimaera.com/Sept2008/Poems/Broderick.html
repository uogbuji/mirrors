		<h4>The Old Friend</h4>
<p>
He aged like a dog: one day, he was fine,<br />
a fit, smiling still-handsome man of 80.<br />
The next time I saw him, he was stooped<br />
and shuffling, his face hollowed out by pain.<br />
Now comes word of pancreatic cancer,<br />
the tumor “aggressive,” bending him<br />
to its will, eating him alive. What do you say<br />
at a time like this? “I’m sorry?” “We'll miss you?”<br />
Already my words travel forward<br />
to the moment, a few weeks from now,<br />
when he’ll no longer be around to hear anything.<br />
So I keep silent, sitting beside the window,<br />
listening to the cry of a cardinal trying<br />
to kick-start spring into turning over.
</p>
<p><img height="306" alt="" src="../images/oldfriend.jpg" width="380" border="0" /></p>
<h4>Picking the Apostles</h4>
<p>
At first they can’t believe their ears.<br />
They are amazed. They are always amazed.<br />
The argue among themselves — what did he say? —<br />
voices muffled with excitement. They ask him again,<br />
faces strained, hoping for a different response.<br />
They are just like us. They bargain. They quibble.<br />
They parse words. They hear only what<br />
they want to hear. You didn’t really mean it.<br />
You’re not leaving. The cancer hasn’t spread.<br />
I will be spared. But the answer is the same.<br />
Abandon your mother. Abandon your father.<br />
Abandon your children. Renounce your home,<br />
your country, your tribe, your brothers,<br />
even the name you were given at birth.<br />
Life exchanged for death. Death exchanged for life.<br />
One by one they begin to slip away, eyes<br />
on the ground as if searching for something.<br />
One by one they leave until all that’s left are<br />
a dozen too dense, too slow to escape in time.</p>
