		<h4>Out of the Picture<img style="MARGIN-TOP: 14px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="324" alt="" src="../images/parasol.jpg" width="216" align="right" border="0" /></h4>
<p>And so, as in some formal wooded scene<br />
By an Impressionist,<br />
The lady with the tilted parasol<br />
And gravel-kissing hem saunters between<br />
The poplars, where contented couples loll<br />
Beside a river’s idling sheen,<br />
Then turns aside unnoticed and unmissed</p>

<p>Out of the picture. Still that patient eddy,<br />
There where the willow’s pending<br />
Compliant withe is dabbling in the stream,<br />
Revolves the same reflexion with a steady<br />
And self-absorbed attention. The couples seem<br />
Insensible. The path’s already<br />
Forgotten her, her promenade and its ending.</p>
<p>The day, indifferent to both time and place,<br />
Moves elsewhere and moves on.<br />
As pointless to depart as to delay:<br />
In either course is folded the same space.<br />
In Istanbul next year or here today:<br />
The figure with the unseen face<br />
Steps quickly from the picture and is gone.</p>
<h4>Time Out</h4>
<p>Only the trees perhaps, the sleeves of grass,<br />
Leaning against the light learn to compose<br />
The windbent seconds as they pass<br />
In cells of cellulose.</p>
<p>Or else the creatures in their quest to kill<br />
And to survive, deliver or devour,<br />
Stretch to its limit as they fill<br />
The membrane of the hour.</p>
<p>But you, where <em>are</em> you in the falling day?<br />
Some drowned god drags your foot off Sounion.<br />
This quartet eats your heart away.<br />
You stare, but the sky is gone.</p>
<h4>2:00</h4>
<p>The hook receives the wire and its null weight.<br />
Hung on the white abeyance of the wall<br />
This door into the dark at two a.m.,<br />
A blackness framed in black, seems to install<br />
An absence there to unsubstantiate<br />
Canvas and plaster where the two of them<br />
Meet to contrive their empty stratagem.</p>
<p>At lower left the first step of a stair<br />
To nowhere. A bare doorframe climbs to lose<br />
Itself in shadow like a seeping stain.<br />
Beyond the door the same shadow imbues<br />
Bare floor; the hallway and its wall are bare:<br />
A vacant threshold, immanent membrane<br />
For what may pass in or return again.</p>
<p>And so I woke up at the painted hour<br />
And turned and found you there, my dead belovèd,<br />
Deeply asleep, washed with as faint a glow<br />
Of night as that in which the floor is covered<br />
Before the doorway where the shadows lour.<br />
Shaken from sleep and propped on one elbow,<br />
I stared to see again that face I know.</p>
<p>I watched your dreaming profile, I watched you,<br />
Pillowed in shadow and your wavy hair,<br />
Your body’s form unthreatened and content<br />
As in the life, till waking should undo<br />
What sleep persuaded in my eyes. But there<br />
You lay and stayed for time to represent<br />
Your long unbeing’s brief embodiment</p>
<p>Not as the lapse of seconds but an age.<br />
No fear, but passing shock, then wonder filled<br />
My watching as I leant by you, held fast,<br />
Certain that you would turn to me, and thrilled<br />
By what soft whispered nothings would assuage<br />
The three mute years without them that had passed.<br />
But not a move. No word. No breath. At last</p>
<p>I tentatively stretched a tender hand<br />
For you, both to confirm and to caress<br />
The thickness of those waves, and instantly<br />
The whole of you resolved to evanesce.<br />
Your head became the shade it lay on and<br />
Your shape was made away; it seemed to me<br />
The quilt sank into your nonentity.</p>
<p>Why did you choose this night of all the nights<br />
That I have lain here asking for your ghost?<br />
Perhaps for all the doors I thought to lock<br />
Against the dark, the one that matters most<br />
Is in the house and open and invites<br />
Your coming with no need to call or knock;<br />
And you entered by the door of two o’clock.</p>

		Stephen Edgar is an Australian poet known for his mastery of form and, in Clive James’s words, “a limitless wealth of cultural reference, and an unmatched ability to make science a living subject for lyrical verse.” He is a former poetry editor of <em>Island</em> magazine. His six published collections are <em>Queuing for the&nbsp;Mudd Club</em>, <em>Ancient Music</em>, <em>Corrupted Treasures</em>, <em>Where the Trees Were</em>, <em>Lost in the Foreground</em>, and — the most recent — <em>Other Summers</em> (Black Pepper, 2006). His new collection, <em>History of the Day</em>, will be published in early 2009.
