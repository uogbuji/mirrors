		<h3>The Public Loved her Wednesday</h3>
<p><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 9px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="200" alt="" src="../images/millay.jpg" width="180" align="right" border="0" />The wrinkles made it hard to be Millay —<br />
the naughty, love-intoxicated elf<br />
who put her indiscretions on display<br />
to keep her verses flying off the shelf.<br />
Though she was quick to give her love away,<br />
she found no one as lovely as herself.<br />
At thirty-six she had a mid-life crisis<br />
and sought a younger partner for her vices.<br />
<br />
She spent her dissipating charms to snare<br />
George Dillon, twenty-one. Oh! He was cute.<br />
A poet who had all his teeth and hair<br />
(and headed for a Pulitzer to boot).<br />
They publicized an adequate affair<br />
which quickly bore Millay artistic fruit<br />
in songs of love. When their romance was through,<br />
she published them as Fatal Interview.<br />
<br />
She documented each romantic joy,<br />
straining the limit of her lyric art.<br />
It was for her the Greeks invaded Troy,<br />
not even death would cure her wounded heart.<br />
She bandied words with Venus and her boy,<br />
but never named a reproductive part.<br />
Writing a paean to the arrowy child<br />
was Vincent’s way of saying she went wild.<br />
<br />
She had a husband who was undemanding,<br />
although she hardly mentions poor Eugene.<br />
Of course the couple had an understanding.<br />
That didn’t stop the cuckold turning green,<br />
but not enough to think about disbanding<br />
while she was busy playing slave and queen.<br />
She found her lapses easy to excuse<br />
as long as critics gave her rave reviews.<br />
<br />
But aging isn’t subject to reverses.<br />
Prematurely superannuated<br />
by booze and dope, she slurred a stream of curses<br />
when critics called her forms and diction dated.<br />
They traded in Millay for freer verses,<br />
and some proclaimed that she’d been overrated.<br />
In increments, she lost what she loved most,<br />
and haunted her estate as her own ghost.<br />
<br />
Bohemians still propagate the fiction<br />
this libertine who used her friends to sate her<br />
salacious whims and carnal predilections<br />
had really been her gender’s liberator<br />
when she was just a slave to her addictions.<br />
But who am I to judge her decades later<br />
from second-hand accounts that don’t quite mesh?<br />
I wish that I had known her in the flesh.</p>
