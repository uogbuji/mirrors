		<h3>Adjustable Wench</h3>
<p>A flibbertigibbet of little account, I thought her;<br />
She’d do for a time, though young for this old grizzled beard.<br />
It little deterred me that people might think her my daughter —<br />
Just so long as she gave me my oats, though I boozed and I leered.</p>
<p>A dancer she was, so she told me; I asked her no more;<br />
Some coyness of manner suggested she’d rather not tell<br />
What species of dancing she did, or what costume she wore<br />
Or discarded at work; but if cynics can fall, then I fell.</p>
<p>It wasn’t her bedcraft alone, though that was a marvel.<br />
(I’d call it an effing one, aiming at literal fact,<br />
But that would fall short, for this was sublimely ineffable,<br />
The ultimate <i>premier cru</i> of the physical act.)</p>
<p>It was always at my place we met, a long afternoon,<br />
And we never examined why this was the pattern, not that.<br />
But one day, one morning, I answered a whim, none too soon,<br />
And strolled to the street where she lived, and called at her flat.</p>
<p>She came to the door in a robe, and missed not a beat.<br />
She welcomed me in, to strains of Saint-Saëns, and I took<br />
It all in with a glance, and turned on my heel in red heat —<br />
The man in her bed, and the wine, and the poetry book.</p>
<p>So I left in a furious temper, slamming the door.<br />
The old story, yes; but what cut me right to the core<br />
Was the man — some years older than I, a wreck on the shore<br />
Of old age — and her red and black <em>pointe</em> shoes ranged on the floor.</p><br />

&nbsp;<br clear="all" /><h3 style="MARGIN-TOP: 0.6em">Ern Malley’s Account of the Affair</h3>
<p>A fiction I, who was conceived and born&nbsp;<br />
and storied one fanciful barracks afternoon<br />
when two young formalists in poetry,<br />
idle young soldiers, sat in their Melbourne room<br />
and, in a fever of glee and laughter, wrote me.</p>
<p>They cobbled together my <em>oeuvre</em> first, from motley<br />
sources: a map-reading guide, a <em>Wörterbuch</em>,<br />
a wartime primer on insect-borne diseases...<br />
They used what they had, like ad lib cooks, astutely,<br />
often to strange surreal effect, which pleased them.</p>
<p>Their aim was to show up forties modernist verse<br />
for the empty sham that they believed it to be —&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
to have my surrealist poems taken for real,<br />
by Harris, an Adelaide poet-editor, firstly,<br />
then maybe by Eliot, Treece, or Thomas in Wales.</p>
<p>My verses done, the two of them called me deceased.<br />
As my sister they sent in samples, her covering letter<br />
artfully artless. Hooked, he printed and praised them,<br />
was echoed by pundits — Eliot, Herbert Read<br />
and others, who, though some said these antics amused them,&nbsp;</p>
<p>held to their views long after the fraud was known,<br />
declaring the Malley poems a triumph — better<br />
than any that either one had written before.<br />
Poor Harris, first caught by the joke, was hit by another<br />
when next he was forced to defend my verse in the courts!</p>
<p>In a farcical trial, Detective Vogelsang<br />
of the local police pointed to certain words<br />
of alleged obscenity, one of which was “incestuous” —&nbsp;<br />
a term he could no more construe than mimic birdsong:<br />
even non-readers found my verse licentious!</p>
<p>And what of the perpetrators, the two who made me?<br />
The work, they declared, was quite devoid of merit —<br />
a joke, an experiment, bad and rubbishy verse.<br />
So where’s the truth? Can art come from insincerity?<br />
In the shakedown of time, which view has fared the worse?</p>
<p>The last laugh’s mine. They killed me with Grave’s Disease<br />
at twenty-five. Six decades on, I’ve outlived<br />
them both; my works are debated still, stand fast<br />
when theirs, from days of uniforms or civvies<br />
alike, are all but forgotten, are formal dust.</p>
<p>Ah, the dagger of malice, that wounds the most<br />
its wielder! As if we ever really pretend,<br />
or ever stop! Each work has a fiction or myth<br />
or persona for author, and every fiction exposes<br />
something unconscious, some unintended truth.</p>

<h3>À La Belle Étoile</h3>
<p><em>for Phil McCann</em></p>
<p>I think of a summer night when we,<br />
vivid and voluble with promise,<br />
sat out for hours under a ceiling of stars,<br />
swinging our youthful legs in the breeze,<br />
blind drunk on happy tomorrows.</p>
<p>Though only death can stop time dead,<br />
time that evening slowed for a freeze-<br />
frame moment, a limelight flash of self-recall,<br />
which still revisits me when dreams<br />
tug at memory’s sleeve.</p>
<p>I think of us then, so bold, so sure<br />
that both were movers-and-shakers-to-be;<br />
and I think of us now — you, past pain, gone in<br />
somewhere beneath a timeless roof,<br />
and I still under the stars.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Lost Wax</h3>
<p>His wrestler’s fingers, huge beneath the loupe,<br />
fashion the wax, plying a slender blade<br />
with fine control. This lizard eye, this blind<br />
eye bulging, pared minutely with its droop<br />
of lid, is but a ghost-precursor, made<br />
to bring to birth the eye that’s in his mind,<br />
the lizard eye of silver, every groove<br />
and fold and contrast metalled into life.<br />
So too this waxy scaliness of tail<br />
must conjure lizard skin at one remove.<br />
Nor is this fact peculiar to the knife:<br />
art must look past what burns away, or fail.</p>
<p>And still, of all the lost wax lines I write<br />
not one has turned to silver in her sight!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Implicate Order</h3>
<p>You know the kind of puzzle where you slide<br />
plastic tiles around — say fifteen squares<br />
of picture fragments? Have you ever eyed<br />
that one blank space untempted, as it dares<br />
you from what seems disorder? Go on, prove<br />
your human skill to straighten, set things right,<br />
undo the chaos; and if you try one move,<br />
you’ll try a chain of them to bring to sight<br />
the hidden, not lost.&nbsp; What if the world is all<br />
and always thus — its order part-implicit,<br />
folded in? We think that what we call<br />
disorder is mere randomness, but is it?<br />
What if this folding in and out’s the face<br />
and core and quiddity of time and space?</p>
