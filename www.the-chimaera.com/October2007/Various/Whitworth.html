		<h3>The Examiners</h3>
<p>Where the house is cold and empty and the garden’s overgrown,<br />
They are there.<br />
Where the letters lie unopened by a disconnected phone,<br />
They are there.<br />
Where your footsteps echo strangely on each moonlit cobblestone,<br />
Where a shadow streams behind you but the shadow’s not your own,<br />
You may think the world’s your oyster but it’s bone, bone, bone:<br />
They are there, they are there, they are there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
They can parse a Latin sentence; they’re as learned as Plotinus,<br />
They are there.<br />
They’re as sharp as Ockham’s razor, they’re as subtle as Aquinas,<br />
They are there.<br />
They define us and refine us with their beta-query-minus,<br />
They’re the wall-constructing Emperors of undiscovered Chinas,<br />
They confine us, then malign us, in the end they undermine us,<br />
They are there, they are there, they are there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
They assume it as an impost or they take it as a toll,<br />
They are there.<br />
The contractors grant them all that they incontinently stole<br />
They are there.<br />
They will shrivel your ambition with their quality control,<br />
They will desiccate your passion, then eviscerate your soul,<br />
Wring your life out like a sponge and stuff your body down a hole,<br />
They are there, they are there, they are there.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In the desert of your dreaming they are humped behind the dunes,<br />
They are there.<br />
On the undiscovered planet with its seven circling moons,<br />
They are there.<br />
They are ticking all the boxes, making sure you eat your prunes,<br />
They are sending secret messages by helium balloons,<br />
They are humming Bach cantatas, they are playing looney tunes,<br />
They are there, they are there, they are there<br />
&nbsp;<br />
They are there, they are there like a whisper on the air,<br />
They are there.<br />
They are slippery and soapy with our hope and our despair,<br />
They are there.<br />
So it’s idle if we bridle or pretend we never care,<br />
If the questions are superfluous and the marking isn’t fair,<br />
For we know they’re going to get us, we just don’t know when or where,<br />
They are there, they are there, they are there.</p>

<h3>Them There Out There In Here Right Now</h3>
<p>There’s a tickle in your nostrils like the turning of the milk,<br />
There’s a swish across your fingers like the whimpering of silk,<br />
Like the flutters of a death’s head, like the squitters of a mouse;<br />
You can feel them in the lobby, you can feel them in the house,<br />
There’s a flickering of faces, there’s a bristling of hair,<br />
At the elbow of a passage, at the winding of a stair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Till you feel them everywhere</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>In the air.</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Yes, you feel them everywhere.</i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Pitter-patter like the creeping of the waves across the stones,<br />
You can trace the gothic filigree of tiny little bones,<br />
Trace their frettings with your fingers on the velvet of the dark;<br />
Trace their restless to-and-froing like the swimming of a shark,<br />
To-and-froing in their going like a prowling picaroon<br />
In a wilderness of starlight on the deserts of the moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>And they’ll be here very soon</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>How they croon&nbsp;</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>They’ll be here so very soon.</i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
They are swarming in the dawning, there’s no turning of the tide.<br />
They are homing through the gloaming and you’ve nowhere left to hide.<br />
They are swinging from the cornice, they are sliding down the sill.<br />
<i>Have they come to do you good or have they come to do you ill?</i><br />
As they whisper at the window, as they mutter at the door,<br />
With a scrabbling down the chimney and a squeezing through the floor,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Till you’re theirs for evermore;</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>It’s for sure</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>That you’re theirs for evermore.</i></p>

<h3>Humdinger</h3>
<p><i>(Getting louder)</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; See I saw the feller humming,<br />
he was coming, he was coming, through the wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; like a bandit in a hood<br />
and it wasn’t looking good, no way,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so I started in to pray<br />
but my wits had gone astray (wouldn’t yours?),<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;big paws full of claws<br />
and enormous jaws, full of teeth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; white teeth, sharp teeth,<br />
he was furry underneath, and his breath,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hot breath, foul breath,<br />
made you think of sudden death, with the smell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of a shuttered room in hell;<br />
so I knew full well I was done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it isn’t any fun<br />
when you’re out without a gun, if things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with teeth and wings<br />
(did I say about the wings?) like these,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;come thrumming through the trees<br />
till you’re weak about the knees, with their hum,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with their drum, drum, drum,<br />
and their fi--fo–fum,&nbsp; in the wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where it isn’t looking good,<br />
&nbsp;no way …<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no way…<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no way…<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; no way…</p>
<p><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Not You</h3>
<p>If you were not the one who brought the milk,<br />
And you were not the one who ruled the land,<br />
And you were not the one who wove the silk,<br />
And you were not the one who held my hand,<br />
And you were not the one who touched my face,<br />
And you were not the one who kissed my hair,<br />
And you were not the one who’s off my case,<br />
And you were not the one who wasn’t there,<br />
And you were not the one who lost my life,<br />
And you were not the one who fell apart,<br />
And you were not the one who chose the knife,<br />
And you were not the one who broke my heart,<br />
Then you were not the one who’s in my head,<br />
And you were not the one who’s dead, who’s dead.</p>
