<h3>In the gap</h3>
<p>
<img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="253" alt="campion" src="../images/one_white.jpg" width="179" align="right" border="0" />Listen. No, look. The last campion<br />
White in the hedge’s dark.<br />
<br />
What is campion?<br />
A ragged flower<br />
Tall as a child<br />
With a slender leaf<br />
Red in the hedge’s dark.<br />
<br />
But is it rare?<br />
As all things are<br />
In the autumn dusk<br />
In air as sharp<br />
As a half-ripe berry,<br />
Your speeding car.<br />
<br />
What will it give me<br />
If I stop<br />
With my keen eye<br />
My heart’s delight?<br />
Nothing. No thing.<br />
A crow’s cry. Night;<br />
White throat the wind strokes.<br />
Listen.</p>

<h3>Affairs</h3>

Miss Monson came from Lincolnshire. So did I. As yet<br />
I am not the only daughter of a wealthy baronet.<br />
How respectful was her lawyer’s smile.<br />
<br />
Miss Monson moved to Cheltenham. So did I. But then<br />
The cattle browsed by High Street upon common land, a fen.<br />
Enclosure came. How broad the lawyer’s smile!<br />
<br />
My house has three small bedrooms. Miss Monson built up nine.<br />
Her pleasure gardens ate their fields, would sink and swallow mine,<br />
As her crisp notes were melted by his smile.<br />
<br />
She built a towering terrace. She named an avenue.<br />
Stairs swept, iron wrought, the new roof soared. Her debts were mounting too.<br />
A woman of your talents need not trouble, breathed his smile.<br />
<br />
Miss Monson came to London. How hard, her nephew said,<br />
She bluffed, then cried. The bank had failed. The list of fees was read.<br />
Where was the charming lawyer with his smile?<br />
<br />
She hid in France, she slipped back. She paid small bills, grew old.<br />
Tanks loom like roofs by sweated troops. A man steps, sharp and cold,<br />
The crude oils splash, the white teeth flash. We pay the lawyer’s smile.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Plucked from</h3>
I have been grey for years.<br />
How did brows keep<br />
<br />
Their darkness? But no more.<br />
One hair is sleek<br />
<br />
Ticked grey. Busy badger,<br />
See the heap<br />
<br />
Of cracked stones I dislodge.<br />
Though fingers weep<br />
<br />
Mud, blood, I scrabble on.<br />
For I would sleep.<br />
<br />
I breathe the wet, fresh earth.<br />
I will dig deep.
