		<h3>Posterity</h3>
<p>
We could be happy now and, if you are,<br />
I hope my tangled ramble will not spoil<br />
a perfect day. I have no wish to mar<br />
your mardi gras or to disturb your oil<br />
with troubled water, nor to bring you pain.<br />
The opening took so long I’ll start again.<br />
We could be happy now, as birds of air<br />
(which ones? the happy ones of course) but there<br />
is something evil holding us in thrall -<br />
Posterity — the notion drives us spare,<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.<br />
<br />
Instead of stepping out to travel far<br />
and wide, we hide inside to sweat and toil<br />
on some dull masterpiece, apply the tar<br />
and feathers to our own behinds. We boil<br />
our brains in brine, the better to attain<br />
the unattainable, the merest grain<br />
of immortality. We claw and tear<br />
at trivia and pray that we may fare<br />
better than all our fellows. To stand tall<br />
among the greats, to shine without compare,<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.<br />
<br />
No need to play the precious superstar.<br />
Sufficient to be diligent and loyal<br />
in service of the muse. Avoid the bar<br />
at least till one o’clock and show a royal<br />
displeasure verging on a fine disdain<br />
to anyone who asks us to explain<br />
our antisocial tendencies. Beware<br />
of all who interfere. A rabid bear<br />
with toothache is a model sure to stall<br />
the curious; or freeze them with a glare,<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.<br />
<br />
And everywhere from Ayr to Zanzibar<br />
a hell of fellow scriveners embroil<br />
the waking hours in faking on a par<br />
with Stevenson or even Roddy Doyle.<br />
A form of madness favoured by the vain,<br />
this writer’s clamp, the stamp of the insane<br />
and insecure. Poor fools who never dare<br />
to do, we step aside and idly stare<br />
at braver players fighting for the ball,<br />
call it “research” and pack it neat and square<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.<br />
<br />
Take Valient-for-Truth: each mark and scar<br />
bore witness to his time above the soil,<br />
but who will value scratches on the car<br />
as evidence of valour? We recoil<br />
too late from recognising that the main<br />
thrust of our lives was gazing at the rain<br />
and sitting, sitting, sitting in a rare<br />
resemblance of a scrawny Rodin, bare<br />
bulb overhead, in front of us a scrawl<br />
of doomed ambition, martyrs to a chair,<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.<br />
<br />
Posterity, you ought to have a care.<br />
You’re irresponsible, for everywhere<br />
in every age you lead to our downfall.<br />
We banish happiness, embrace despair,<br />
as if the future cared for us at all.</p>
<br />
<h3>Helga’s Chickens</h3>
<p>
Helga’s Chickens take the floor<img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="398" alt="" src="../images/chicken240.jpg" width="240" align="right" border="0" /><br />
around eight thirty every night.<br />
Could anybody ask for more?<br />
Perhaps some spotty troglodyte<br />
<br />
would rather hide away and write<br />
computer code, but what a bore<br />
and hardly likely to delight<br />
Helga’s Chickens. Take the floor<br />
<br />
for instance — even if it wore<br />
a carpet of a lurid white<br />
our eyes would still be on the door<br />
around eight thirty. Every night<br />
<br />
the Paranormal’s heaving. Quite<br />
a crowd prepares for what’s in store<br />
and brightens as they dim the light.<br />
Could anybody ask for more<br />
<br />
than Helga and her brood? Before<br />
you rush to call her “parasite”<br />
or breathe the appellation “whore”,<br />
perhaps some spotty troglodyte<br />
<br />
will rush to her defence and cite<br />
an evening back in ’94<br />
when he succumbed, gave up the fight<br />
and sang “O come let us adore<br />
Helga’s Chickens!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Paranormal Hotel</h4>
<div class="just"><p>(Excerpts from <a href="http://paranormal-hotel.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">the eponymous blog</a>, by Paraglider)</p>
<p>The Paranormal Hotel, Dubai, with its notorious Chalky’s Bar, is an institution and a UAE phenomenon. Sadly, it can’t last much longer in its present form and, once gone, it could never be replaced. A new Panorama might rise, Phoenix like, from the ashes, but the Paranormal will be no more. And what will then become of <strong>Helga’s Chickens</strong>?</p>
<h5>Without Prejudice</h5>
<p>Paraglider was still musing on how long it had taken the ants (near the cash point) to rebuild their walkway after the last sandstorm, as he stepped from the sunshine into the Paranormal, then sharp left into Chalky’s, darkness and temporary blindness. For the unwary, this is a dangerous two minutes and it’s best not to speak till the eyes recover. From somewhere on the left — <i>Me, I come from the US, Doll. Pennsylvania. Ever heard of it?</i> Clearly a Broadcaster. From somewhere closer — <i>Hello, what you name?</i> From straight ahead — <i>Sir?</i> (a welcome voice). — <i>Pint of Stella, please</i>. And as the fog lifts, the Broadcaster is seen to be wearing shorts and hiking boots with socks, and has started shouting about camel toes. Beam me up, Scottie.</p>
<h5>A Taste of the Dark</h5>
<p>Eric’s dance was a long time coming. Maybe half a dozen double whiskies and fourteen tentative approaches from all nations East of Turkey. He seemed impervious, even to the wiles of Kyrgyz Carina who retired gracefully, knowing herself rebuffed, albeit in barely comprehensible slurred County. Enter Stella from Eritrea, beaming her beam as only she can. Eric’s dance began, all elbows, knees and wire-rimmed glasses. Snake-charmer par excellence, you’d almost think he didn’t know he didn’t have to try. From her corner stool, Carina said something like “Blyatt!”</p>
<h5>Your Feet’s Too Big</h5>
<p>There’s good posture, and there’s presence. Anna has both, especially the latter. And eyes. Eyes that don’t so much look as inhale. Rather like the old Superman comics: <i>Aside — With my X-ray vision, I can see that he’s carrying a ray-gun in his haversack</i>. It turns out (since you have no option but to talk to her) that her father was in the KGB and doesn’t know she’s in Dubai. Which says a lot for intelligence. And that she was an aspiring ballet dancer with a wodge of potential until, sadly, her feet grew too big. Well, they’re not huge, but, looking down, her story is certainly believable. Still, you might think there would be some happy medium between stardom and the Para. Maybe some modern dance troupe with progressive attitudes towards feet? Apparently not. So it’s good to know that the Paranormal is there, rather like a donkey sanctuary, for ballerinas in free-fall.</p>
<h5>When Don Quixote met Ella Gow...</h5>
<p>The talk soon came around to dancing. His pantaloons were incongruous but, in her green drndl hand-me-down, she herself was scarcely a model of elegance. None of which seemed to matter as, seamlessly, they moved from talk to practice. Well, more of a lesson, if truth be told, as Ella, till now, had only read of the Pavane. The Don’s grace and courtly manners were matched only by her guileless acquiescence and, perhaps, by the vacuous stares of the seven attendant Livingstone Daisies, resplendent in their black neckerchiefs and white lace petticoats. There were none to mock, for it was Tuesday, and barely dark.</p>

		<div class="endnote">
		
<p>Dave McClure had written sporadically all his life, but became hooked about ten years ago when he started contributing to a number of on-line forums and workshops. He writes in English and modern Scots, mostly in form, and with no particular life theme, preferring to ring the changes in subject matter and style. If he ever “finds his voice” it’ll be time to stop. He is currently living and working in the Middle East where there is plenty of raw material for his taste for the surreal. A lot of his poems end up <u><font color="#0000FF"><a href="http://www.c-change.co.uk" target="_blank">here</a></font></u>.</p>
