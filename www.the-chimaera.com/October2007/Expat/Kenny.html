<h3>The Messenger</h3>
<p>to James K. Baxter</p><p style="FONT-SIZE: 90%; MARGIN-BOTTOM: 1.3em; LINE-HEIGHT: 1.4em; MARGIN-RIGHT: 9em"><i>The New Zealand poet James K. Baxter (1926-1972) chose to work 
as a 
postman rather than accept the academic jobs that were easily within his reach. 
Wellington gales are famous.</i></p><p>
Wellington wires scream in high wind and moan —<br />
the telegraph poles strain steep up hectic hills<br />
and bluster-blown postmen, wet and chilled to bone<br />
drag mail bags using mountaineering skills,<br />
<br />
as goat-like they withstand a slippery track<br />
and fend off ankle-snapping dogs to boot,<br />
inspired by legends of a poet, back<br />
in days when poets pounded beats by foot.<br />
<br />
Jimmy Baxter, driven poet, earned<br />
his living as a postman, while he dreamed<br />
and wrote his poetry all unconcerned<br />
with how he was perceived or how esteemed.<br />
<br />
Eccentric man, he carried letters more<br />
than any postman ever did before.
</p>

<h3>Leaving New Zealand for Europe on a One-Way Ticket</h3>
<p align="left">The ship sailed slowly out the heads<br />
to sea and all I knew was lost<br />
to me. In ignorance I tossed<br />
security away in shreds.<br />
Dark water swirled around the hull<br />
as isolation clamped my heart.<br />
Familiar ties were ripped apart<br />
and I was ignorant and small.<br />
Adventure seemed a tawdry prize;<br />
deep love was traded in exchange<br />
for lucky-dips and random strange<br />
diversions in this enterprise.<br />
Embarked on something cold and vast<br />
I wept to see my die was cast.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>A Different Green</h3>
<p><i>(Longing for the Port Hills in Canterbury New Zealand<br />
while drowning in the bright green of England)</i></p>
<p>Green, too uniform for south-sea eyes,<br />
the trees and grass identical, as though<br />
this&nbsp;greenness was intent to emphasise<br />
my alien need for green chiaroscuro.<br /><img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-RIGHT: -10px" height="274" alt="" src="../images/DifferentGreen.jpg" width="180" align="right" border="0" /><br />
I dreamed dark macrocarpa on the gold<br />
of sun-bleached tussock, combed by winds that came<br />
from nor-west, with hot, dusty breath to scold<br />
the polished heights no gales will ever tame.<br />
<br />
Broad, massive without angles; heavy grace<br />
of monumental wind-eroded curves,<br />
where once an ancient forest had its place.<br />
Now grasses claim that forest’s old preserves.<br />
<br />
Sure English green was lovely, but not mine;<br />
I longed for contrast in my green design</p>
<p class="smaller"><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Out There</h3>
<p>One moment light, then dark — no power.<br />
The suburb stopped in sullen shock,<br />
without a warning, for a block<br />
all motors died for half an hour.<br />
Twittering heedless through the trees,<br />
two small marauding ringtail possums<br />
cheerfully sought for shoots and blossoms<br />
unaware of our unease.<br />
Little marsupials, monkey-tailed,<br />
hooked on branches and extended<br />
hands for flowers which were intended<br />
for such as these, then up they sailed<br />
as though no gravity existed;<br />
over canopies they skittered,<br />
barely touching as they littered<br />
poo and petals till they misted<br />
into darkness where they vanished,<br />
leaving me to wait for light<br />
and when it came, too harsh, too bright,<br />
I longed for what my world had banished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Finding the poet</h4>
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">S</span>ome of us were born expatriates. I certainly was. My provincial New Zealand family was an impoverished branch of a family that had seen better days. My parents feared that their children would pick up “common speech and manners” from “rough children”. This fear was encouraged by my father’s elder sister, who remembered better days. Her speech was decidedly Edwardian. She was known in educational circles in Britain as well as New Zealand, for her children’s verse speaking choirs. Before I could walk she had me reciting:</p>
<blockquote><i>“A birdy with a yellow bill</i><br />
<i>hopped upon my window sill.</i><br />
<i>Cocked its saucy head and said:</i><br />
<i>“Ain’t you ashamed you sleepy head.</i>”</blockquote><p>This story was vouched for by numerous relatives. I was a “strange” child. Adults would get me to talk to them just so they could hear the pompous utterances that fell from my infant lips. I felt a bit like GBS’s Eliza Doolittle when she said: <i>Here! what are you sniggering at? If I was doing it proper, what are you laughing at?</i></p>
<p>My aunt, Flora Alexa Stevens, was a poet as well as a teacher. During the Second World War she was published in a British poetry anthology which included Robert Frost, Rabindranath Tagore, Vida Sackville West, W. H. Davies, Roy Campbell, A. E. Housman, Alex Comfort, Eileen Duggan and many other notables. My parents knew nothing of this, of course. She received no appreciation in her own philistine family.</p>
<p>Here is one of her poems from that anthology:</p>
<blockquote><b>Casualty</b><p>He is gone. We did not see him go,<br />
When from our isle he darkly, silently,<br />
Slid on smooth waters by the sheltering land;<br />
His grey form still, his heart vociferous,<br />
His sky-blue eyes keen, he watched awhile, no doubt,<br />
The hills of Wellington become a blur<br />
Of twinkling lights; the little sandy bays<br />
Where his brief boyhood shrieked the summer through<br />
Show as small curves of light, elude his gaze,<br />
And disappear in stars and midnight blue.<br />
<br />
He is gone... there were some waiting weeks...<br />
And then a blessed word... we breathed again<br />
And hoped. The sun was warm all day, birds sang,<br />
Our own sky-thrilling lad alive as they.<br />
We ceased our moods of silence, and our hands<br />
Knew their accustomed labour. We were glad<br />
To live, because he lived. He was on land<br />
After the treacherous waters... Oh, soft rain<br />
Fall lightly on him! Sun-soaked summer sand<br />
Blown idly by, rest for a moment. Air<br />
That was his world, be still as you pass there,<br />
Where he lies now who will not fly again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only poetry I knew as a child was in the English books given to me by my aunt. When I was thirteen I stood up in class at the request of my teacher to read Walter Scott’s poem “Young Lochinvar”. I started it with verve and passion.</p>
<p><i>O, YOUNG LochinVAR is come OUT of the WEST...</i> The entire class shrieked with laughter. I sat down and refused to read aloud for the rest of my schooldays. I knew I was right and they were wrong.</p>
<p>I was in my late teens before I discovered New Zealand poets. I felt vaguely cheated. People had been writing about my own world while I was being directed to look across the sea. At that stage of my life I was absorbed by acting, music and painting. I played Beatrice in a school production of “Much Ado About Nothing”. Shakespeare stayed with me. Poetry was peripheral but intriguing. I met the poet <a href="http://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writers/baxterjk.html" target="_blank">James Keir Baxter</a>, <span class="smaller"></span>a passionate, loquacious yet introspective idealist.</p>
<p>Here is the opening stanza from Baxter’s “Rocket Show”:</p>
<blockquote><i>As warm north rain breaks over suburb houses,</i><br />
<i>Streaming on window glass, its drifting hazes</i><br />
<i>Covering harbour ranges with a dense hood:</i><br />
<i>I recall how eighteen months ago I stood</i><br />
<i>Ankle-deep in sand on an Otago beach</i><br />
<i>Watching the fireworks flare over strident surf and bach,</i><br />
<i>In brain grey ash, in heart the sea-change flowing</i><br />
<i>Of one love dying and another growing....<br /></i><br />
(“bach” is a New Zealand term for a small beach house.)</blockquote>

<p>I recognised something of myself in him. I knew he would have shocked my aunt. A school friend of mine married the New Zealand Polynesian poet <a href="http://www.nzepc.auckland.ac.nz/features/taonga/campbell.asp" target="_blank">Alistair Te Ariki Campbell</a>. After separating from his first wife, the poet Fleur Adcock, he married my friend. His poems do not break easily into fragments.</p>
<p>Here is a broken piece of one of Alistair Te Ariki Campbell’s poems:</p>
<blockquote><b><i>Blue Rain</i></b><br />
<br /><i>Blue rain from a clear sky.</i><br />
<i>Our world a cube of sunlight—</i><br />
<i>but to the south</i><br />
<i>the violet admonition</i><br />
<i>of thunder</i><br />
<br /><i>Innocent as flowers</i><br />
<i>your eyes with their thick lashes</i><br />
<i>open in green surprise.</i><br />
<br /><i>What have we to fear?...</i>
</blockquote>
<p>I left New Zealand with my husband, to live in London. Work and survival as a classical singer consumed all of my energy. I became aware of contemporary English poetry mainly through the electronic media. Roger Woddis, the irreverent English satirist, delighted me.</p>
<p>Here is a stanza from his “Down With Fanatics!”:</p>
<blockquote><i>Fanatics are an evil breed</i><br />
<i>Whom decent men should shun;</i><br />
<i>I’d like to flog them till they bleed,</i><br />
<i>Yes, every mother's son,</i><br />
<i>I'd like to tie them to a board</i><br />
<i>And let them taste the cat,</i><br />
<i>While giving praise, oh thank the Lord,</i><br />
<i>That I am not like that...</i>
</blockquote>
<p><img class="pullquote_left" alt="text quote" src="../images/pq_kenny.gif" align="left" border="0" />The nature of my work as a classical singer meant that I was still excluded from the immediate life of the country in which I lived. I vaguely admired the words of some of the Beatles’ songs although as a musician I wondered at the popularity of their music. Shortly after my arrival in London I read of the suicide of Sylvia Plath. Her poetry was barely mentioned. She was a feminist martyr as far as the Sunday papers were concerned. I met someone who had been part of her close circle during her days in Devon. I never heard her poetry mentioned. Occasionally Sir John Betjeman appeared dottily in his cardigan on television as he challenged modernity with his unrepentant but amusing conservatism.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the unkempt television appearances of the American poet Allen Ginsberg, who used to sit cross-legged on the floor, sounding his Indian finger cymbals while reciting his poems.</p>
<p>I was living my poetry through performance. It was built into my daily life. Meter and mood were my constant companions.</p>
<p>I read a great deal of poetry but nearly always in relationship to songs.</p>
<p>I was discovering too many things at once to pause for any one of them.</p>
<p>Still, I ached with homesickness. The English countryside was all that its poets claimed for it but I was unable to feel that essential primitive connection vital for a poet or any other creative artist.</p>
<p>And then ill-health and opportunity combined to end my singing career but start a new life together with my husband, to live in Australia. Another foreign country.</p>
<p>The truth is that Australians are everything that my frightened parents feared. Every sound Australians uttered challenged the genteel expectations of my youth and of the English opera and concert world I had known up to that point. I quickly realised that the old class measurements of speech had no relevance in Australia. It was a magnificent liberation but it left me devalued. The one thing that Eliza Doolittle and I had mastered was valueless in this new world. In my first morning in Australia I watched television with fascination as a nicely dressed woman explained how to make “cikes, pois and pystries.” And everyone pronounced the letter H as “Haitch”. I knew that none of these things mattered but how was I to find my equilibrium in such a place? And it was also experienced in reverse. When I spoke to people in shops they stared at me, then either asked me to repeat myself, laughed, or made some scathing comment. And I couldn’t understand anything that was said to me.</p>
<p>My husband’s work as a publishing executive for a conservative international company made a barrier between us and the easy bohemian types with whom we were accustomed to mix. At my first dinner party in Australia I learned that young boys had their birthdays put into a lottery and if that date was drawn they were sent to fight in the Vietnam War. I expressed my horror to my hosts and quickly realised that I was not in congenial company.</p>
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">O</span>ne day in a bookshop I saw a volume of poems by a New Zealand poet, the late Denis Glover. And there in the shop I burst into tears. I experienced such an ache for the innocence of New Zealand and poets and the landscape that I bought the book and read it like a thirsty dog at a puddle.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of excerpts from a poem of his loved by New Zealanders of my generation, “The Magpies”. The Australian magpie has spread to New Zealand and its carolling song pervades much of the countryside.</p>
<blockquote>When Tom and Elizabeth took the farm<br />
The bracken made their bed,<br />
And <i>Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle</i><br />
The magpies said.<br />
<br />
Tom’s hand was strong to the plough<br />
Elizabeth’s lips were red.<br />
And <i>Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle</i><br />
The magpies said...<br />
<br />
Elizabeth is dead now (it’s years ago);<br />
Old Tom went light in the head;<br />
And <i>Quardle oodle ardle wardle doodle</i><br />
The magpies said...
</blockquote>
<p>And an excerpt from “Threnody”, another poem by Denis Glover:</p>

<blockquote><i>In Plimmerton, in Plimmerton,</i><br />
<i>The little penguins play,</i><br />
<i>And one dead albatross was found</i><br />
<i>At Karehana Bay...</i>
</blockquote>
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">I</span> found my courage and started writing letters to Australian newspapers. They published them. They published so many that I still have a thick folder full of clippings.</p>
<p>Writing letters to a newspaper is not dissimilar to writing a poem. The same discipline is needed. You must resist including too many ideas and concentrate on the main message. You must be parsimonious with words.</p>
<p>Then one day I wrote a letter that evoked a phone call from an established Australian immigrant poet, Margaret Diesendorf. “You are a poet,” she told me. I was astonished. She sent me a copy of her own published collected work. Here is an excerpt from one of her poems:</p>
<blockquote><b>Summer Tourist in Paris</b><p>Among the women of all lands,<br />
the milling crowds, (the dark, the blonde,<br />
the lean, the plump) I walk —<br />
ghost who does not belong —<br />
ghost who has lost her home<br />
and errs through foreign streets<br />
seeking another, in vain.<br />
One location remains<br />
untried:<br />
<i>le Dôme</i><br />
<i>des Invalides.</i><br /><br />
A puff of wind, a storm,<br />
a freak commotion:<br />
I’m blown<br />
into an eerie catacomb.<br />
“Velgome!”<br />
a dead soldier shifts<br />
in his ancient tomb<br />
of porphyry.<br />
A marshal? General? Admiral? —<br />
Napoleon!..
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later I met the Australian Nobel laureate Patrick White. “I read all your letters”, he said. “They’re very good”. I was shocked.</p>
<p>When I collaborated on a book about Chernobyl I insisted that it should contain some poems contributed by women who had experienced the effects of the fallout.</p>
<p>I had always written poetry but didn’t think it was anything serious. It was my secret.</p>
<p>I worked for years in the bleak and terrible world of nuclear disarmament. That is dreadful for a poet. To live with death and nuclear winter every day of your life when you are just beginning to rediscover who you are is not something I can describe.</p>
<p>Then one day a small, abandoned half-fledged nestling walked up to the feet of my husband who was doing some carpentry in the garden. It bonded with both of us. It learned everything with us. It practiced whirring its wings around and around as it stood on my husband’s sawhorse. It sat on my shoulder. It launched itself into the air only to land on the ground with a thud. Its feathers had not fully formed. It learned to sing as it sat on my knee. The bird I recognised as its delinquent parent sang to it and it absorbed the lesson. Out of its puny body came ancient roulades and trills and scales. It was an Indian Mynah bird and it freed me from depression. One expatriate helped another.</p>
<p>That was exactly how I discovered poetry. I didn’t find any common language with the Australian poets although I loved many of their poems. I had to find my own voice by listening to all of the poets who reached me. I was unaware of national barriers. I love much Australian poetry because it says something that only someone who lives in Australia can say. I am in love with Australia. I say what I feel and it probably doesn’t reach many Australians or New Zealanders. I have spent too many years away from tribal speech. I must be my own poet.</p>
