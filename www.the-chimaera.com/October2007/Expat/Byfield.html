		<h3>Week Two, Year of the Dog</h3>
<p>The jets are back. I’m writing.<br />
There’s no connection. It’s morning<br />
and I’ve slept too well, dreamed of people<br />
from long ago, my friend<br />
who’s married now to a woman who arouses<br />
suspicion, the way she looks<br />
at him, the stark age difference,<br />
her calculating parents.<br />
<br />
We were playing cricket. Ten years later<br />
it still stings that I didn’t get a bowl<br />
in that match, the words of a team mate<br />
afterwards, <i>you batted like a girl</i>.<br />
It rained all the next week.<br />
<br />
There are thirty shells on my table<br />
from Thailand. Tiny perfections.<br />
There might be a God, this morning.<br />
<br />
So — poetry, a run, some Chinese study.<br />
I have a hand woven Naxi rug<br />
to put on my wall — a good day<br />
when I brought that — visits to arrange,<br />
a woman to avoid writing about,<br />
coffee before all that.<br />
<br />
Then one more week of this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Things and Their Absence</h3>
<p>No camels in Canberra<br />
and the Chinese don’t speak Chinese.<br />
Taxis stay mostly on the road<br />
<br />
and go mostly where I tell them to.<br />
I can read the newspapers<br />
and understand there’s not much<br />
<br />
worth reading. No caves pock<br />
the hills and no pagodas spill<br />
between skyscrapers, into the lake.<br />
<br />
Restaurants serve Mongolian lamb<br />
but it’s about as Mongolian<br />
as I am. It’s windy outside<br />
<br />
but there’s absolutely no chance<br />
a typhoon is brewing.</p>
<br />
<h4>Lunch, Day Three</h4>
<div class="just">
<p class="blockbegin"><span class="drop">I</span> walk down past the River Front Restaurant, which although picturesque as a Sidney Nolan painting is full, so I keep walking, through a large-eucalypt shadowed park into the main street. I’m amazed when I stop to cross the road and a car stops for me — I give them a broad grin. In China they would have run me down.</p>

<p>I head to the <i>Corner Coffee Shop</i>, where the afternoon sun bakes the plastic outdoor furniture. After minus-three last night it’s now warm enough for a T-shirt. I sit down inside, where I find myself within eye-shot of an older blond lady who looks straight off the farm and sexy in an <i>I ride horses</i> sort of way. This sexiness is accentuated as she licks cappuccino from her bottom lip.</p>
<p>A waitress strolls over to take my order. She smiles and calls me <i>Sir</i>. This too is a surprise after a year of being laughed at and stared at, hair pulled or, most often, called <i>laowai</i> (consider for a moment if a Chinese person walked into an American restaurant and the owners or other eaters called him <i>Asian</i>, to his face or in front of him — that’s the equivalent.)</p>
<p>I order the turkey and cranberry sauce sandwich, with extra cheese, carrot and onion, which after one bite is clearly to die for, and a large black coffee which surpasses all expectations in this, one of two cafes in the Inland Fishing Capital of Australia. I was expecting river water, in tune with the Paul Kelly lyric <i>It was the colour of the river, but not nearly as brown</i>.</p>
<p>I finish coffee and sandwich and am feeling opulent, so I try to get the younger waitress’s attention. I catch her gaze and give her a little wave, which she misinterprets, smiling back and giving me a wink. This is very different to China, where if I looked at a waitress she’d generally quit her job and run from the premises. Or want to marry me.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later I rise and head for the counter, eyeing off the chocolate cake (remembering an amazing slice of chocolate cake I’d had in the <i>Caribbean Café</i> in the deserts of western China a few weeks previously, while waiting for a rickety domestic flight) but am accosted by a visually delightful cheesecake and change my mind. An older woman says <i>hi</i> and calls me <i>darl</i> which makes me feel right at home and quickly brings me cheesecake and ice cream, both of which are the colour of wheat and taste like magic.</p>
<p>Across the road an old brick building with an old metal sign saying <i>Pastoral Chambers: 1895</i> casts a shadow over the street. Next door, in bright red paint, a shopfront announces <i>Fair Dinkum Variety</i>. On the street beneath, a ute rattles past with two brown sheep dogs grinning dumbly in the tray.</p>
