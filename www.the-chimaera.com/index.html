<h3>Marvels</h3>
<p class="byline">by Peter Coghill</p>
<p>The Greeks could calculate the world’s circumference from shadows,<br />
and what expansion from Eratosthenes till Einstein could say,<br />
“and then I had the most beautiful thought of my life:”<br />
<br />
that in free fall there is no force of gravity —<br />
and on from there to metric tensors, bent light,<br />
black holes, G<sub>μν</sub>=8πT<sub>μν</sub></p>
<p>
and an exploding universe.<br />
But enough of reach<br />
<br />
when with those commonplaces of leaves and sky<br />
to walk the street you must inoculate for awe,<br />
and across the room are things not to be understood,<br />
<br />
like why my wife has given me peonies, very pink,<br />
frilly like lace undies, so not me, and when asked why<br />
her answer, as answers do, only increases the wonder.</p>

  <h3>Practical Proverbs</h3>
<p class="byline">by Susan McLean</p>
<p>
A penny saved is useless.<br />
A stitch in time looks shabby.<br />
If life deals you lemons, they’re juiceless.<br />
The early bird is crabby.<br />
Two heads are one too many.<br />
Let sleeping bosses nap.<br />
You can’t buy thoughts for a penny.<br />
A bird in the hand will crap.<br />
Home is where the hurt is.<br />
He who laughs last is thick.<br />
What can’t be cured is herpes.<br />
You can’t get straw from a brick.<br />
A friend in need won’t buy.<br />
You’re never too old to die.</p>

 <div id="potd2" style="display: none">
  <p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 1.1em"><b><i>The dray horses sleep</i></b></span><br />
with fumes of bog myrtle on their hooves.<br /><br />
Fieldfares drift down<br />
to eat ice-cold rowanberries.<br />
<br />
And time slept<br />
with my childhood on its arm.<br />
<br />
I remember trying to wake up time<br />
hurry it along<br />
so childhood would end<br />
youth disappear<br />
and adulthood finally arrive.<br />
<br />
Well, here I am now<br />
and baffled<br />
to have caught up with time<br />
and my own body<br />
and entered a rapport of sorts,<br />
definitive, with both of them.</p>

  <h3>At Sea</h3>
<p class="byline">by Philip Quinlan</p>
<p>She mimes the unimaginable cry:<br />
a splintered thing which shipwrecks in the throat;<br />
a stranded vocal, starting high and dry,<br />
then unsustainable; a sunken note.</p>
<p>The man with news, who held her hands, has gone.</p>
<p>She knows a hurricane is heading for the coast;<br />
tomorrow there’ll be time enough to drown,<br />
but, once the holding’s done, all hands are lost.</p>

  <h3>Going to the City, Karachi 2010</h3>
<p class="byline">by Les Murray</p>
<p>As the tractor-exhaust<br />
vistas of desert sky<br />
resume the south ahead<br />
the farmer and his family<br />
are moving to the city</p>
<p>in debt and crusted cloth<br />
at the river’s speed<br />
close but not together<br />
going and reappearing<br />
under the raft of noon</p>
<p>moving to the city</p>

  <h3>Metaphysical Sonnet 6: Origami</h3>
<p class="byline">by Amit Majmudar</p>
<p>The oracle an origami ibis<br />
hatches is scratch paper, crisscross-creased,<br />
inside, a crayon’s idle scribble, <i>ibis</i>,<br />
that nature flown which nested in the folding.</p>
<p>The unseen spins its cobweb in the corner<br />
of an eye, and through this ticklish ghost of matter&nbsp;<br />
light lobs its pebble photons, which go on<br />
to give the all clear to the retina.</p>
<p>If spirit is not light but a sieve for light,<br />
and vision a sense cleft-grafted onto sight<br />
like a branch in bud that triggers the stalled stalk,</p>
<p>I say stitch up the eye’s eternal hemorrhage<br />
and let the hand’s imagined aviary<br />
on folded wings take flight.</p>

 <h3>Graven</h3>
<p class="byline">by Brian Culhane</p>
<p>
There’s no word here<br />
Requiring a gloss;<br />
Each line runs straight,<br />
No meaning lost.<br />
<br />
So may thought run<br />
Across granite:<br />
Let no breath mar<br />
What’s upon it.</p>

  <h3>Five to Midnight</h3>
<p class="byline">by Mary Byrne</p>
<p>I surprised my father, combing his white hair&nbsp;<br />
Slowly, before the mirror in the bathroom.<br />
The door was open, the light was on,&nbsp;<br />
It was five to midnight, the radio said.</p>
<p>Glad to find him taking such trouble, at 89 — &nbsp;<br />
(His 90th year, as he’d quickly point out)<br />
Before retiring with his wife (going on 87),<br />
I recalled the handsome man in ’30s snaps: &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Beige flannels, tweed jacket, a rifle on his arm.</p>
<p>Then I saw the look in his eyes:&nbsp;<br />
<i>Caught in the act</i>, they seemed to say,<br />
<i>Apologies, for taking up space&nbsp;<br />
On such a useless effort.<br /></i>He smiled and put the comb away.</p>
<p>I was only checking the light wasn’t forgotten<br />
An old habit of his, the late night security check.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I rise in the night silence of orange street lights<br />
And study my own face in the bathroom mirror.</p>

  <h3>Roué</h3>
<p class="byline">by T.S. Kerigan</p>

<p>He sorts the things those creatures left behind,<br />
Their locks of black, brunette, or yellow hair,<br />
Their silken articles of underwear,<br />
Those heiresses whose names now slip his mind.<br />
If sad to see him take their wealth and leave,<br />
They never could forget his savoir-vive.</p>
<p>Yet all his handkerchiefs and pillowslips,<br />
He swears, contain the scent of her perfume<br />
Who lingered but an hour within this room,<br />
Surprised to think that scent, that pair of lips,<br />
That woman’s face he hasn’t seen in years<br />
Should now eclipse this trunk of souvenirs.</p>

  <h3>Rock Music</h3>
<p class="byline">by Les Murray</p>
<p>Sex is a Nazi. The students all knew<br />
this at your school. To it, everyone’s subhuman<br />
for parts of their lives. Some are all their lives.<br />
You’ll be one of those if these things worry you.</p>
<p>The beautiful Nazis, why are they so cruel?<br />
Why, to castrate the aberrant, the original, the wounded<br />
who might change our species and make obsolete<br />
the true race. Which is those who never leave school.</p>
<p>For the truth, we are silent. For the flattering dream,<br />
in massed farting reassurance, we spasm and scream,<br />
but what is a Nazi but sex pitched for crowds?</p>
<p>It’s the Calvin SS: you are what you’ve got<br />
and you’ll wrinkle and fawn and work after you’re shot<br />
though tears pour in secret from the hot indoor clouds.</p>

  <h3>Number Disconnected</h3>
<p class="byline">by Timothy Murphy</p>

<p><i>for Helen Hecht</i></p>
<p>I’ve known other widows to do just this,<br />
to leave a voice, the tone, the background hiss<br />
on a machine the husband cannot answer.<br />
Telephone tag. Voicemail from a dancer<br />
whose final decade was a sarabande,<br />
the stately wave of a magician’s wand.<br />
Missing that voice, I dial his number still.<br />
I hope we will talk again. I pray we will.</p>
