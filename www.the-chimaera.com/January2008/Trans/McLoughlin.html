		<h5>A New Take</h5>
<p>(from the Irish of Cathal Ó Searcaigh)</p>
<p>You becalm me out of morning<br />
mist with musk of bog myrtle<br />
on your heather cloak. The white<br />
streams, limbs, flowing around me,<br />
giggling, welcoming me with skylarks.</p>
<p>You gaze at me, translucence in those<br />
big lake-eyes: Loch an Ghainimh and<br />
Loch Altáin, each full of clear sky,<br />
glowing like summer on your cheeks.<br />
You loose a veil of mountain breeze;</p>
<p>a May heat-haze that looses easily the<br />
secrets of my heart. And I see completely<br />
all the beloved boundaries of your body:<br />
from Log Dhroim na Gréine at the hollow<br />
of your back to Alt na hUillinne’s elbow bend.</p>
<p>Through Mín na hUchta, the valley<br />
of your breasts and the red slope of<br />
your cheeks at Mhalaidh Rua, my eyes<br />
slide over your concave, convex beauty;<br />
each sun-spot, each beauty-spot</p>
<p>I had forgotten since I left you.<br />
But I know now what the city lacks<br />
and I pray for an end to exile, for shelter<br />
here between the paths of your white legs;<br />
for a new turn in the poem of my destiny.<br /></p>
<p><img height="416" alt="" src="../images/mcloughlin_newtake.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>
Shepherd</h5>
<p>(from the Irish of Cathal Ó Searcaigh)
</p>
<p>Here sixty years of hardships are<br />
calloused in the grip of his claggy mit.<br />
The constant struggle with the tyrant<br />
mountain above Loch Altan shows<br />
in the sloth of his walk. This mean,<br />
famine stricken land has drunk<br />
for years the sweat of his effort,<br />
left him spent, drained him dry<br />
as a bog stump. Those desires<br />
that bloomed in his heart’s district<br />
withered quickly. This is Prochlish:<br />
remote in the mouth of wilderness.<br />
The sky frowns, the sun laughs wryly.</p>
<p>There, under Achla’s monstrous shadow<br />
no woman pleasured him, kisses never lit.<br />
Love’s jubilation never rose in his heart’s tundra.<br />
These little flocks of sheep have the run<br />
of the mountain, dogging from Mín na Mhadaidh<br />
to the top of Beithí, but he is bound<br />
between the menacing ditches.<br />
When the drop’s in, he’s out<br />
like a wandering sheep leaping<br />
the mind’s ditch, looking for grass<br />
in the hungry winter of the dark,<br />
rooting the recesses of the mountain.</p>
<p>Beyond, when he sees a scattering of bones<br />
on the path or when his dogs rend at carrion,<br />
he is heart struck by the fear of death.<br />
Among the woolly silence of the rocks,<br />
the oozy drip of bacon fat, repeats, burning<br />
in his guts like the heavy dark that thickens<br />
in his mind, falls like a stone from Achla,<br />
fires the night-terrors and the dreaming.</p>
<p>Yonder, in the bare flagged kitchen<br />
hunched in his chair over a meagre fire<br />
he mutters and mumbles at the loneliness;<br />
cursing it away. Terror snarls at the conflagration<br />
from the dark, waiting to sneak in. It gnaws<br />
at his head like the rats in the ceiling<br />
clawing and nibbling at the edges of his mind.</p>
<p>Once, his heart would swell and thump<br />
with pride at the Dromma Mór thundering<br />
through the crossroads on St. Patrick’s Day.<br />
But these nights now, he lies on his bed<br />
listening to the muffled drum of his own heart<br />
as it weakens, begins to falter.</p>
