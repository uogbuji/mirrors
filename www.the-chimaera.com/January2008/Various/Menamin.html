		<h5>The Hoofman</h5>
<p>They said he was the devil. Where he walked<br />
the earth sprang scars, knife-deep and subtly splayed.<br />
The women whispered in their gloves and talked<br />
of how he sometimes came to them but made<br />
<br />
them mostly want to follow him. He stayed<br />
alone, could not be tracked, gave no address.<br />
He seemed to have a preference for shade<br />
or darkened places. Though the men were less<br />
<br />
aware of him and not inclined to guess<br />
his hidden haunts and habits, women fought<br />
to learn his secrets, begging to possess<br />
his arrogance. And, bit by bit, he taught<br />
<br />
delicious wicked thoughts, set them afire<br />
with fantasy and candor and desire.</p><br />
<h5>Caged Lizard</h5><p style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 7em"><em>These are roaming animals with large space needs for their&nbsp; size...uromastyxes are burrowing lizards, and need substrate deep&nbsp; enough to burrow&nbsp; in, or a low structure under which to hide. — Wikipedia.</em></p>
<p>The uromastyx on display<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; turns tail upon his audience<br />
and readies for another day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; exposed, enclosed behind a fence.</p>
<p>The dry gray cactus on the floor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; is meaningless to one who's known<br />
the Asian sunlight at his door<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and warmed himself on honest stone.</p>
<p>This shrunken world bewilders him:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There were no corners in his past.<br />
Existence is a synonym<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; for futile searching to the last.</p>
<p>Intent upon the task at hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; he patiently ignores us all.<br />
He scratches in the shallow sand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; he pushes at the metal wall.</p>
<br />
<h5>Afternoon of a Faun</h5>
<p>You have seen him before<img style="MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="359" alt="" src="../images/sleepfaun.jpg" width="210" align="right" border="0" /><br />
when he loitered on the edge<br />
of a landscape somewhere in childhood<br />
or one of those faraway dreams<br />
that happened in another forest:<br />
those colors you remember<br />
that have no names.</p>
<p>Now you step off the old log road<br />
into a sudden clearing<br />
that was not there yesterday.<br />
Grass brilliant as glass<br />
teases your memory,<br />
draws your eyes to the sleeping form<br />
at the center of paradise.</p>
<p>You stand still as a moth<br />
but the birds, the mad joyous birds<br />
peal like bells from the grove.<br />
He turns and meets your eyes<br />
and for a moment he is not afraid.</p>
<p>Then he sees how your hands<br />
are filled with years. He does not know<br />
how to read the history of your face.<br />
A white butterfly teaches him to evanesce<br />
and you are alone in the trees.</p>
