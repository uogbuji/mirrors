		<h5>1957 Pontiac Super Chief</h5>
<p><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="158" alt="" src="../images/superchief210.jpg" width="210" align="right" border="0" />It was a summer world of grasshoppers<br />
and weeds and the Pontiac Super Chief<br />
my Dad parked in the back yard.<br />
Chief Pontiac’s glass face was the ornament,<br />
on the pale green hood; it lit up<br />
when we turned the headlights on,<br />
face full of light that blazed<br />
down the new-made interstates;<br />
the stereotypical stoic Indian look:<br />
high cheek-bones, thin lips, straight nose<br />
hooked at the end. He gazed out<br />
on forsaken lands, on landscape altered<br />
by time, supplanted by settlers;<br />
his glass-carved face set firm,<br />
unspeaking through the seasons;<br />
stoic to winter snow or August heat —<br />
August when we made a game,<br />
were warriors and went out to fight for him,<br />
and when we were in peril he would leave<br />
his perch on the hood and fly,<br />
a comet or a meteor in the night,<br />
to strike the enemies who threatened us<br />
like Pontiac did when he besieged Detroit,<br />
gathering an alliance of tribes, keeping the English<br />
pinned down for months on end. He realized<br />
he could not take the fort and withdrew<br />
to Illinois. The new United States sought<br />
him out, negotiated with him. Later he was killed<br />
by an Indian from the Peorian tribe<br />
over some petty dispute. The myth could live,<br />
and it ranged high those days. Texaco<br />
sold Sky Chief gasoline. Pontiac had Star Chief,<br />
Super Chief — products to erase accumulated loss.<br />
In the lands he ruled and walked, spaces<br />
where he was feared or venerated,<br />
his cut-glass face divided the air —&nbsp;<br />
the Wabash River, islands in the stream<br />
of the Detroit, the massive trees<br />
of Michigan, Great Lakes, old demesne<br />
of the Ottawa, Mingo, Potawatomi,<br />
Miami, Delaware.&nbsp; Place names now,<br />
or product names, stamped faces made<br />
of glass, of chrome, or phantoms pale<br />
as light, names uttered, memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5>The Impossibility of Epithalamia</h5>
<p>Absurd to write them — to lodge the alchemy<br />
of marriage into lines of poetry;<br />
to put restraint on the oldest mystery;</p>
<p><em>The mystery is great. I think it means<br />
Christ and the Church.</em> So Saint Paul gleans<br />
the meaning — or at least to him it seems.</p>
<p><em>A man shall leave his parents</em>, Genesis<br />
says, <em>and be joined to his wife, and then one flesh<br />
they will become.</em> Paul’s mystery is this.</p>
<p>Of course one flesh is just a euphemism<br />
for those moments of ecstasy and spasm,<br />
groaning madness ending in orgasm.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s the steady architecture<br />
of building two lives into one conjecture,<br />
staying together under insane pressure.</p>
<p>So poems like Spenser or like Herrick made<br />
to celebrate friends’ (or their) wedding days<br />
fall short — and seem more like an escapade.</p>
