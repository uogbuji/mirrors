		<h5>Your Dream of Giant Mushrooms</h5>
<p><img style="MARGIN-TOP: 9px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px" height="341" alt="" src="../images/doreski_mushrooms.jpg" width="250" align="right" border="0" />Your dream of giant mushrooms<br />
confounds you. Big as pillows,<br />
such aggressive fruiting suggests<br />
how shapeless the next evolution<br />
could be. Crouched in your bedroom<br />
with dawn burning in the slats<br />
of your closed blinds, you consider<br />
abandoning your mind somewhere<br />
on the way to work. On Route Ten<br />
a tractor for sale, a Farmall<br />
from the Sixties, red paint faded<br />
as the kisses wasted years ago<br />
on a husband who staggered away<br />
clutching a half-decayed heart.<br />
You’d like to purchase that tractor<br />
to plow a shallow ditch a mile<br />
or two through the forest, loosening<br />
the compact soil to encourage<br />
an army of giant mushrooms.<br />
You could command this army<br />
to rise from its mycelium<br />
and trundle into the city<br />
of Keene and terrorize children<br />
and dogs and disgust the adults<br />
who disgust you every day<br />
with their ignorance and swagger.<br />
But despite the oily texture<br />
of your dream you lack the language<br />
to properly address a mushroom.<br />
And if they ever grew that large<br />
they’d fracture from excess weight<br />
and could hardly march several miles<br />
to intimidate downtown Keene.<br />
But dreams like this require<br />
the respect of exploitation,<br />
so as you pour yourself coffee<br />
and peel a banana for breakfast<br />
the mushroom part of you shivers<br />
with excitement, meaty white texture<br />
exuding the woodsy aroma<br />
that has kept you fresh all your life.

<h5>Seven-Card Stud with the Dean</h5>
<p>I deal myself aces: five, six,<br />
seven of them. He doesn’t care,<br />
his expression plain as a bagel.<br />
Around us the student union sighs<br />
a collective sigh reeking of French<br />
fries, sweets, and filthy gym clothes.<br />
The dean likes losing at cards<br />
because he’s won so much in life —<br />
tenure, an overripe salary,<br />
and a mannequin-perfect wife.<br />
<br />
He doesn’t realize he lost her<br />
two hands ago, signing the usual<br />
IOU without looking. One night<br />
as his bedroom fills with stars,<br />
as his body and hers rehearse<br />
that eternity he’s sure they’ll share,<br />
the doorbell will ring, and wrapped<br />
in my blackest cloak I’ll enter<br />
with a lawyer buff as a turbine<br />
and a bailiff big as the Bronx,<br />
and will take legal possession<br />
of the woman he thought he owned.<br />
<br />
Out in the street I’ll free her,<br />
of course, the joke not so funny,<br />
and if she wishes to hustle back<br />
to her formaldehyde spouse,<br />
let her. More likely she’ll doff<br />
her flimsy nightgown and sprint<br />
gleaming up and down the street<br />
emitting a single high note,<br />
inviting the moon to explain her.<br />
<br />
The dean smiles as I sweep the cards<br />
from the table and shuffle them,<br />
and the sweaty and greasy smells<br />
drape over him and annul<br />
whatever cunning thoughts he had<br />
when he was young and scholarly,<br />
before he succumbed to his flesh.</p>
<br />
<h5>A Boulder Larger than My House</h5>
<p>
The smell of the morning rain<br />
has penetrated a boulder<br />
larger than my house. Leaning<br />
against its terrible density<br />
I absorb that rain-smell the way<br />
I absorbed you when you swept<br />
from California to New England<br />
with your intellect still intact.<br />
<br />
Geese wheel honking overhead,<br />
their chevrons still imperfect<br />
but their compass-sense aligned<br />
with polar magnetic forces<br />
no one questions. The boulder<br />
impresses with its indifference,<br />
as you do. The lichen inscribed<br />
on its west and north flanks presents<br />
enigmas too rigorous<br />
for botanists to transcribe;<br />
<br />
but at this moment you’re scanning<br />
comparable legends scrawled in gray<br />
brain matter almost as tough<br />
as lichen, and reading the results<br />
to patients whose neuroses compare<br />
favorably to mine. You learned<br />
your trade by reading Nietzsche<br />
and William James, ignoring Freud<br />
and Jung, my favorite charlatans.<br />
<br />
No wonder we’re hardly friends<br />
any more. The rain-flavor sweetens<br />
the forest. The geese fluster south,<br />
following a single line of force.<br />
As I watch the sky the boulder sighs<br />
a very old sigh and I stroke<br />
its cold rough expression the way<br />
I’d stroke you if you’d let me,<br />
the autumn-brown forest smiling<br />
through its fuzzy, old-fashioned beard.
