<h4>A Timeshot, Joseph Conrad In Picture<br />
<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: normal; FONT-STYLE: italic">‘One Hundred Years Ago’</span></h4>
<p>Outlandish to be thought of as having lived.</p>
<p>And yet this little person in her sun-bonnet,<br />
knees together, slate of numbers on her lap,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; lit in an oblong brilliance between<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; sail-shadow and deckhouse shadow,</p>
<p>look how she observes us when she should<br />
be at her sums. From her deckchair look<br />
&nbsp; how slyly she peeps at the fellows<br />
&nbsp; who ascend the gummy black verticals,</p>
<p>one by one by one, until they vanish<br />
above her bonnet’s rim into the slanting<br />
&nbsp; dazzle of the tropic light.<br />
&nbsp; What does she conjecture for us?</p>
<p>that we are tarry spiders in our caps,<br />
smutches of smoke ascending into heaven?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No more than I can make tomorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; can I make her present thoughts.</p>
<p>Yet into her extremest age this darling might<br />
carry these instants of barefoot fellows climbing&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; high to grease a topmast or hand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; and bend fairweather canvas.</p>
<p>And if she carries this, will we be there<br />
beyond such time as hands of ours can reach?<br />
&nbsp; Outlandish, the old lady coiled<br />
&nbsp; unmade in this white-muslinned child.</p>
<p>For I can’t even say that light and shade<br />
will be the same, that girls will wear white bonnets<br />
&nbsp; in the sunlight where she combs&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; and plaits her silver hair,</p>
<p>and says to her children’s unimaginable children,<br />
<i>I came, you know, in the sailing ship, Torrens,</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; with Captain William&nbsp;Cope. That was</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;&nbsp; in eighteen ninety two, the year</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>a short first mate was of that crew who all</i><br />
<i>the sailors there called ‘Polish Joe.’&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>&nbsp; My dears he had such long arms</i><br />
<i>&nbsp; but spoke politely in his accent.</i></p>
<p>Already we know the ships of taut grey canvas<br />
will have gone by then —&nbsp;&nbsp;for plainly the future<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; parleys with us as it likes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the steamship smoke smarting our eyes.</p>
<p>And yet you can’t, unless by fancying what<br />
has never yet been made, transfer your eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; to how the scene with Little Miss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; grown old will want to set itself.</p>
<p>Except it will. But what I’m trying to say<br />
is how we each get in that freight that’s carried<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; a little way beyond our lives,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; shot like sun-motes into the future’s</p>
<p>tropic dazzle. So call it outlandish to think<br />
of all those unmade years she’ll live beyond<br />
&nbsp; this moment of our muscles here<br />
&nbsp; and give our presence here its future.</p>
<p>For does the dolphin, nosing at the cutwater,<br />
sense a future any instants after<br />
&nbsp; the feed it’s watching for? What if<br />
&nbsp; the very time beyond my saying this</p>
<p>is uncreated till myself or some bright spark<br />
has fashioned it to mean a thing? Or more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; than just a thing? Which makes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; whatever havens where we might</p>
<p>bring home our memory-freight, the time-seeds<br />
picked from all that was, outlandish indeed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this to watch our other selves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; migrating finely toward hereafter?</p>
<p>(from ‘Twelve Sea Pictures’)</p>
<h4><i>From</i> <b>The Skald Mosaic</b></h4>
<p><i>7. A Scene At Grimur’s House</i><br />
</p>
<p>Here is a man, Grimur, walrus-trembly,<br />
and his laugh is a walrus bark,<br />
who arrived home late with companions,<br />
hands slimed from the handling of salmon,<br />
having stood daylong in the quick<br />
salmon flutter of the Gletta River.</p>
<p>Here hums a man Grimur, heedless of his person,<br />
who therefore must set a household to fussing,<br />
who shoulders scolding with wink-wink,<br />
kiss-kiss and thunk of several fish<br />
that slip across the scaling table,<br />
Grimur, lynchpin of the grand cheery world,<br />
world which naturally<br />
now&nbsp; looks for its dinner.</p>
<p><i>13. Skular’s Skip-song</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
Here comes Skular Scattered Brains,<br />
on his chin are egg-yolk stains.<br />
Watch him give you such a look<br />
will make you eat your silly talk.</p>
<p>
Here comes Skular Butterface,<br />
Doctor grumbles <i>Here’s a case!</i><br />
Skip one, miss one, have you heard<br />
Skular thinks that he’s a bird.</p>
<p>Skular likes to stroke your bones,<br />
could crunch them nicely with his stones,<br />
but he loves you far too much<br />
to ever make you ache and itch.</p>
<p>Here comes Skular serpent mouth<br />
God locks him in a skin called Youth.<br />
Skip one, miss one, did you know<br />
Skular Skular loves you SO!</p>
<p><i>21. Katla With Skular-Bird</i><br />
<b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br />
The feathersmell at his armpits,<br />
The lice I cracked with my fingernail.<br />
To peel his clothes was like parting plumage,<br />
poor plucked dear, oddboned loveliness,<br />
his beak kneaded my neck gently.</p>
<p>‘Don’t speak, my love,’ I told, ‘Don’t talk at all.’<br />
But he would prattle, ptarmigan and puffin,<br />
squeaked enough for a clifftop colony.</p>
<p>Such longfeet, you saw could crab on an outcrop.<br />
‘Don’t speak my dear,’ but this Skular must chirrup.</p>
<p>Sometimes Katla-witch likes to be alone,<br />
And sometimes Katla takes company,<br />
One midnight sun her conscience made her rest,<br />
Laugh, crack lice in Skular’s shirt hem,<br />
Chance on new rooms behind her old door.</p>

<h4>A Vagary For Philip Mead</h4><p>
When we were schoolies in those purring classrooms<br />
where revolutions massed like summer storms<br />
and empires fell toward the big exams,<br />
Phil, what could we really tell of time and times<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the Year Twelve torpor we talked at?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Interim on their maps, the nations flickered:<br />
the helmeted signatories smiled, scattered,<br />
the light in Sarajevo killed, continued.<br />
<i>History blokes! You’re in it and outside it,</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>mark that paradox!</em><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>Whatever, Sir!</i> &nbsp;And yet it is the bowl<br />
of time’s intactness teases me. Just<br />
to conjure yesterday&nbsp; and presto! glows<br />
a molten portion we’d like to stand back from,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; glassmaker from his cooling whorl.</p>
<p>So let us say we two shall rise from table,<br />
(glasses tumbled, talk a small curmurr,)<br />
and simply slip behind some quiet hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
A deep verandah stillness can enfold us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; where our thought might lead</p>
<p>from selves to two astonished counterparts,<br />
small beneath a heaven serene with tumult,<br />
dark with unearthly light. <i>Is this,</i> I’ll ask,<br />
<i>the underweave</i> <i>of history, its flow</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>of lives in lives, its flow</em><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>between and over lives so conscious, each,</i><br />
<i>that lives must flow.</i> And you’ll reply, <i>We can</i><br />
<i>sidestep the pools of theory now to favour all</i><br />
<i>the chancy metaphors; observe how shy</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>their light, and yet auspicious.</em><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
Whereon, through watchfulness, perhaps we’ll glimpse<br />
history from its outer side, lucent<br />
like a syntax, whole like a life, but O<br />
grandly itself, curve that leans toward,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; though never touches quite,</p>
<p>a ground of meaning. Such, Phil, my vagary,<br />
to make of the aeons a tableau where we see<br />
the glowering one we used to call The Word<br />
existing epicentric in his cyclone,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; while at the same time he lies calm</p>
<p>among the dinosaurs, his flurried moment<br />
shying to a breeze in this our very own summer,<br />
itself&nbsp; a fretwork of perspectives. Look how<br />
our little lives will catch distinctive light,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; our myriad voices, whether</p>
<p>wailing, singing, loving, hateful, meek,<br />
will shape the one, the small momentous music.<br />
Vagary perhaps. But isn’t this as well<br />
the vehicle of our deepest longing, the fine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sobbed pelagic boom</p>
<p>that goads our lives with times when we believed<br />
we swam unconscious in a vast Unconscious?<br />
Rarely appeased, is this the fragile voice<br />
which urges us to finish what we start,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to go in deeper and find</p>
<p>what truly happened then and in that place?<br />
Can only that which is entirely seen<br />
re-enter the instant of&nbsp; the innocent start?<br />
Poets guess at Time, grow wise or silly,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; yet know that to apprehend</p>
<p>wholeness, if only for a moment, makes<br />
them gods and innocent indeed. Perhaps<br />
this is why recklessly we’ll always&nbsp; leap<br />
from the present to imagination’s Present,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; haunting (as I do) the harbours</p>
<p>where what was still is, or tracing language,<br />
along the bright seams of&nbsp; Now and This,<br />
as you do finely. Irritant is the skin<br />
of questions we live inside, and who outgrows it?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Were we to do so, to be,</p>
<p>if only for an instant, in true self-possession,<br />
holding in mind our time <i>which is all time</i> &nbsp;<br />
look how the Seven Oceans would become us,<br />
look how the systole, diastole of galaxies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would become our lives.
</p>
<h4>The Observed Observer</h4>
<p>
From darkness where no stars shine<br />
and the projector is clicking like a stopwatch<br />
you move out from your times to where a time<br />
flickers against an illumined wall,<br />
a time not lost<br />
for all its weather crackles after sixty years.</p>
<p>This is not occult; you shed no place.<br />
The ducted air cresecendos softly,<br />
the further street-noise, sea-noise of vehicles<br />
crescendos softly.</p>
<p>And yet you move into the light that travels<br />
out of former lives, for instance, these five<br />
who strain around their crucial rope,<br />
their vanished bodies rooted to it like molluscs,<br />
their oilskins gleaming like kelp.</p>
<p>They are so close.<br />
Sixty years or sixty centuries —<br />
it is a membrane of time divides you.<br />
Look, here at your shoulder<br />
the sea has spangled in a ruddy beard,<br />
is drooling like a tap from a blonde forelock.</p>
<p>Above them, out of picture,<br />
the drear, monstrous canvas thunders.<br />
But stay with what is shown,<br />
how one has eyes tight shut<br />
as the atrocious tension draws out his arms,<br />
how one, his head averted, seems ready<br />
to leave his arms behind him,<br />
how their knuckles shine like quartz.</p>
<p>And if you know<br />
the simple vehemence of their effort<br />
will become unfashionable<br />
this knowledge is years off from their dance<br />
of inches and inches and an inch,<br />
remoter than the gull-grey unstable horizons<br />
that shatter to foregrounds of waist-high froth,<br />
remoter than their sun, not seen perhaps for a week,<br />
which only moments ago<br />
broke on them like an epoch,<br />
permitting these pictures, this grainy aureole<br />
where they glitter in their time and yours,<br />
unearthly as stars in daylight.</p>
<p>And as you leave the theatrette<br />
for the animal-quick commerce of streets, you know<br />
you are millions of years from the neighbour creatures<br />
where the dolphin grieving the drowned schoolboy,<br />
the lions grieving the snakebitten lioness,<br />
grieve innocent of ancestry. For it is this,<br />
<i>this widest, this thinnest of loves,</i> astounds you,<br />
this care to catch distinctive light<br />
from the vast shopfloor of former lives<br />
where you also will find your place<br />
below the balconies of hindsight,<br />
the long cables of remembrance,<br />
the historian’s desk dishevelled<br />
by diaries, letters, reels of film.</p>
<p>In elation for where light travels<br />
from a myriad vanished origins<br />
you step out beneath your stars<br />
in the light of all predecessors.</p>
<h4>Tree Loppers</h4>
<p>Always before you are quite ready —<br />
you’re in the shower or on the phone —<br />
before the suburb’s cool vestibules<br />
of birdsong and your lawn, prismatic<br />
with sprinkler-dew, can be got ready<br />
for the shattering onset of their solos,</p>
<p>they arrive in a ute with muffler-rattle,<br />
and the boom-boom of fifties rock;<br />
‘Horizon Modifiers Unlimited,’<br />
is emblazoned on the bonnet, and<br />
you note a sticker on the tailgate<br />
that urges, ‘Eat more koalas.’</p>
<p>They accept the tea, black with several,<br />
and begin the daylong crossfire of banter:<br />
the blonde swaggery one who hulks<br />
around the cigarette he’s making<br />
tells you they’re gunna drop the tree<br />
in one shabang right there between</p>
<p>the greenhouse and the Audi, no need<br />
to move the pot plants. But even as<br />
it dawns on you the wisecracks are<br />
a means of subtle surveillance, he’s turned<br />
to Naccers, his gaunt offsider, who,<br />
you gather, tree-lops to finance his calling</p>
<p>for translating Arabic poetry, and,<br />
returning his tobacco, says, ‘Nah,<br />
leave it all to ol’ Fumble and Grumble.“<br />
Once it is established they’re here<br />
as much for the job as loose subversion<br />
of both your world and theirs, they start,</p>
<p>with spanners, oil, conferrals, till one<br />
with animal sudden-ness, leaps at a branch<br />
and shins skyward with a rope.<br />
Whatever your plans for today, forget them<br />
in favour of this craning theatre,<br />
this lofty, improvising ballet</p>
<p>on a stringy, disappearing stage.<br />
Remark how utterly a chainsaw<br />
takes possession of a day<br />
with its not quite monotonal plainsong —<br />
its bursts of unbridled hype, its low<br />
growls of impatience — how it reveals</p>
<p>short-lived beauties, say, the clay-red<br />
roundels of an ironbark’s cross-section,<br />
or a lightning-white torso<br />
cleft into dozens of lovely shoulders.<br />
Theirs, the biggest on the market,<br />
is nicknamed der Führer, with reason,</p>
<p>as its edged, unyielding tongue takes<br />
the lead through layers of intransigence<br />
with a snarl of pure aggression and<br />
a furious spitting of dross. It is tackling<br />
a blue gum gangrenous with bracket<br />
fungus, and leaves your lawn, alas,</p>
<p>littered with blue-green plumage, as though<br />
it were the killing ground of a grand<br />
pheasant shoot. Remark also,<br />
how, for all their talk, their work<br />
is founded on obedience to<br />
a tree’s intricate system of fulcrums,</p>
<p>how scarf-cut and back-cut abet<br />
the tendencies of limb and trunk,<br />
and how the dancer is watching for skew<br />
or the rogue inward swing of a branch<br />
as his mate lowers it on a rope<br />
that uses the tree-barrel as a capstan.</p>
<p>It’s this might prove the telling subversion,<br />
this longing that wells like a sob, to be<br />
alert to the immediacy of things,<br />
to recover presence there, at the nexus<br />
of animate balance and technical nous.<br />
In their time, which is expensive,</p>
<p>they’ll finish up and drive away,<br />
their ute hugely ruffed with foliage,<br />
leaving your horizon modified.<br />
You, and your house, of course, have been<br />
representative, though personally<br />
you’ve done quite well; you paid in cash,</p>
<p>refrained from fussing over details,<br />
and suppressed the niggling feeling that<br />
somehow you spent the day on trial.</p>
<h4>Brief Absence</h4>
<p>
<i>My love is out on her bicycle.</i><br />
<i>Her purple skirt fills like a sail on The Nile.</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
The likeness of a galaxy<br />
spirals in my coffee cup<br />
as breezes finger apple leaves<br />
like mothers in a fabric shop.<br />
I brood and wander restively,<br />
I’m happy enough, is what I say,<br />
prowling my house like an émigré<br />
among the sunlight’s see-through sleeves.</p>
<p><i>Annie is out on her bicycle.</i><br />
<i>Her purple skirt fills like a sail on The Nile.</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
Hungry, and calling for whisky, she<br />
will come home when the little moon<br />
is a grin perched over our apple tree.<br />
Then ice and glass will clink their tune<br />
and she will talk with easy grace.<br />
I was more than happy, I will say,<br />
to listen for the tell-tale sway<br />
of your purple skirts in our moonlit house.</p>
<p><i>My love is out on her bicycle.</i><br />
<i>Her purple skirt fills like a sail on The Nile.</i></p>
<h4><em>From</em> <b>Ill Tempo</b></h4>
<p><i>Reply To A Common Complaint</i><br />
<i>&nbsp;</i><br />
Mention poetry and you’ll find enough<br />
opinions to cry down the recent stuff.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For those who read and love the art<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; are but a tiny, weathered part<br />
within a vast and dissonant convention<br />
where also lonely sergeants count each stress,<br />
and rasp that poems will not pass unless<br />
they’re dressing right and trembling at attention.</p>
<p><i>Hounding Your Bloke From Office<br /></i><br />
(On the forced resignation of Bishop Peter Hollingworth from<br />
the Governor-generalship)</p>
<p>The fair-go country scores no point,<br />
&nbsp; the witch-hunt team scores one.<br />
Equality this, your chance to paint,<br />
&nbsp; the tar on anyone,<br />
to slap and dollop by the pint<br />
until the righteous itch is spent,<br />
whereon you can, with shining face,<br />
resume your small and equal place.<br />

<p><i>Panel Session On Oz ID</i><br />
<b>&nbsp;</b><br />
We love the topic’s vertigo,<br />
how piously we each can rise<br />
to bubble-wrap in journalese<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; the old presentable disguise<br />
of who we are and why we need to know,</p>
<p>how question-time colludes to show<br />
not what’s observed, but how we pose<br />
on mirage sportsfields of Fair Go<br />
beside the partying kangaroos,<br />
Ned Kelly The Good and that Equal Class<br />
that’s never heard of kiss-my-arse.</p>
<p>The Oz ID, that giddy spiel<br />
we play in order to get real.</p>
