<p>When the provisional government fell<br />
he took to the roads on foot,<br />
traveling only at dawn and at twilight.<br />
When the roads gave out<br />
(too many marauders, too many thieves<br />
for his liking)<br />
he entered the forest<br />
(or what was left of it),<br />
moving through a tangle of brambles and briars,<br />
a maze of ways and means.<br />
Until, on the fifth day, turning a bend<br />
in the river, he glimpsed, toward the horizon,<br />
the promised chapel at the chasm’s edge.</p>
<p>This is, you understand, merely a scene<br />
in which a chiliastic free-lance Parsifal,<br />
seeking wisdom or a kingdom or a grail<br />
(holy or otherwise), would most likely<br />
choose to situate himself, making his tenebrous way<br />
from ruined castle to ruined castle<br />
along the stream’s steep edge;<br />
leaping, at last, footloose and sleepless,<br />
from stone to stone. This is merely<br />
a fiction without music,<br />
a song for no-one’s ears,<br />
the sound of some-one whistling in the dark.</p>

<h4>Iceland</h4>

<p>It was all in consequence of a lucky wager<br />
I’d made in California,<br />
the winning question<br />
when I’d won<br />
my fortune<br />
on <i>Jeopardy!</i><br />
in the category<br />
Geography:<br />
“What are Iceland<br />
and Thailand?”</p>
<p>Flying the Great Circle route, coming in low<br />
under the clouds and the Early Warning radar,<br />
our pilot mistook (somehow) the <i>c</i> for an <i>r,</i><br />
landed in Iceland instead of Ireland.</p>
<p>My passport misplaced, my baggage sped on<br />
by a different flight to Bangkok<br />
(“The only two countries whose names end in <i>land</i><br />
whose capitals end with the letter <i>k</i>”),<br />
I’d nothing but the Harris Tweed jacket on my back<br />
(labeled <i>Made in Hungary</i>)<br />
and a pack of traveler’s checks<br />
in small denominations<br />
in dollars, sterling, kronur.</p>
<p>So, alone at Keflavík, without any kin<br />
to vouch for me, I boarded the tram<br />
which bore on its front the un-<br />
pronounceable legend<br />
<i>Hvannadalshnúkur.</i><br />
I boarded with one other passenger;<br />
and, for all the stops<br />
that seemed interminable, no one got on or off<br />
except at Reykjavík, the capital, the Bay of Smokes.</p>
<p>After traveling for what seemed five hours<br />
at five miles an hour<br />
(you know how the New York buses are)<br />
we came to the end of the line:<br />
the edge of Vatnajökull, where again<br />
(she’s in another poem!)<br />
I met the Patroness of Ice.</p>
<p>Greeting me at the unmarked stop, accentless,<br />
she gestured without touching me<br />
and led me up the slope to the upper village<br />
where a dozen brand-new condominiums<br />
made of Lego blocks<br />
and numbered<br />
<i>1A, 1B,<br />
2A, 2B,<br />
3A, 3B,<br />
4A, 4B,<br />
5A, 5B</i><br />
(you get the picture)<br />
clung to the mountain’s edge, waiting out the winter,<br />
warmed by no sun, sung to by some gulls<br />
off course from Ingólfshöfði,<br />
but otherwise (evidently) uninhabited,<br />
music-less and vacant.<br />
“You’re in 5B,” she<br />
said, passing me the key<br />
surreptitiously,<br />
glancing around to make sure no one saw.<br />
(Though who would see?)<br />
I admired her discretion and was intrigued.<br />
“I’m in 1A,” she stated bluntly.<br />
“I see.”<br />
“You can stop by tomorrow to borrow some sugar and tea.”</p>
<p>She told me also<br />
the July temperature here was warmer than in Oslo;<br />
the January temperature in Reykjavík<br />
exactly the same, on average, as that of New York,<br />
“which is twenty-three degrees latitude farther south.”<br />
She told me I’d be warmer in the north<br />
though we were farther north<br />
than Leningrad, Sverdlovsk,<br />
the Sea of Okhotsk,<br />
Ottawa, Thunder Bay, and Banff,<br />
and only a day’s trek<br />
(by Shetland pony) from the Arctic<br />
Circle.</p>
<p>Some time later, under a bearskin blanket<br />
(imported, so she told me, from the Blaskets),<br />
she confided she’d traced her bloodline back<br />
to that alleged twenty percent<br />
who were the first Irish émigrés:<br />
Celtic to the core, dispossessed as always<br />
even then: emboldened by what promise,<br />
what Viking lure or fear<br />
from their first shores<br />
like Saint Brendan,<br />
the first European<br />
known to write of icebergs<br />
(“floating crystal castles,<br />
crystal palaces”),<br />
first to set foot in an unknown<br />
western land and not return.<br />
She said the myths said he’d reached Vineland<br />
before Ericsson, but she<br />
knew better: he<br />
established court in Iceland<br />
far earlier than Arnarson.<br />
And that she was his heiress —<br />
and proved it (to my satisfaction)<br />
by her likeness<br />
and her name (by these same legendary writings),<br />
Elspeth Brendansdottir.</p>
<p>Later, wrapped in that same bearskin,<br />
she showed me waterfalls, cirques, fjords,<br />
the <i>aurora borealis.</i><br />
When I inquired about flights out, she turned evasive.<br />
“All one’s guilts and losses,” she replied,<br />
“hug one for life<br />
as the villages of Iceland hug their thermal springs.”</p>
<p>That was on the winter solstice,<br />
when the sun shone twenty minutes<br />
and the clouds swirled in, all purple,<br />
like the gasses of volcanoes.</p>
<p>The next day, she promised, we’d look for seals<br />
someplace called the Bay of Whales.<br />
But when I woke I was in a rather different place, like Naples.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten the Awacs<br />
at Keflavík<br />
Field, nor the moonlike frozen lava flows<br />
that stretch from Vík to Hof;<br />
nor have I forgotten her promises<br />
(extravagant, untenable)<br />
to take me to the peak of Kverkfjöll,<br />
to teach me that purest, most unchanged of tongues.</p>
<p>And all these years later, under other northern lights,<br />
I am so driven by insomnia that I spend<br />
never two consecutive nights<br />
under the same roof, in the same bed. </p>
