		<h4>Long-Ago Flowers</h4>
<p>
There is a poem I forgot to write<br />
it must be nine, ten years ago<br />
when animals spoke to me<br />
and trees and rocks<br />
were able to growl<br />
and taunt like some<br />
stunning amalgam of<br />
animate and inanimate.<br />
<br />
But if I could run faster<br />
than the speed of light<br />
and return to that time<br />
nine, ten years ago<br />
I would steal the poem<br />
from myself<br />
stick it in my back pocket<br />
perhaps pick a bouquet<br />
of long-ago flowers<br />
and hurry back<br />
to what passes<br />
as today.
</p>
<h4>Life on Another Planet</h4>
<p>
a man with a face so mysterious<br />
in its contours and overpowering beauty<br />
it made both women and men<br />
wonder about the prospect of love<br />
a decent man but seemingly without a history<br />
worth mentioning, an undisturbed past,<br />
who sat cross-legged on his lawn<br />
in an unexpected light snowfall of late autumn<br />
and waited “for their words of instruction”<br />
that, at least, is what he said to neighbours<br />
forward enough to touch his shoulder<br />
and ask why he was sitting cross-legged<br />
in an unexpected light snowfall of late autumn<br />
<br />
the house was sold during a cold winter’s day<br />
and before the spring thaw<br />
a new family moved in<br />
too thin wife, three sad-eyed children,<br />
and a husband whose face<br />
was misshapen but as mysterious<br />
as the man’s whose face of overpowering beauty<br />
made both women and men<br />
wonder about the prospect of love<br />
and who is now part of the neighbourhood lore<br />
as having sat cross-legged on his lawn<br />
until he received urgent words of instruction<br />
and vanished like the passing of autumn</p>
