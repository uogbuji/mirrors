		<h4>Reverse Moses</h4>
<p>I would wish a Moses in reverse —<br />
Moses retrograde, Moses bizzaro —<br />
Moses who would lug the heavy stone plates<br />
Rembrandt drew so well,<br />
covered with Hebrew script,<br />
back up Mount Sinai<br />
and hand them to God.<br />
“People don’t like these rules,”<br />
he would say. “Can’t we come up<br />
with something else?”<br />
He would turn snakes to staffs<br />
so children would not be bitten<br />
when they played by the Red Sea;<br />
and he would tell Pharaoh to let his people go.<br />
“You’re not a god,” he’d say, “and they know that.<br />
<i>Your</i> people are the ones who need freeing.”<br />
He would hold up his magical walking stick<br />
and locusts would evacuate the land,<br />
lice die, frogs hop away, hail, murrain<br />
disappear. The Nile would become<br />
unbloody — clear so you would see<br />
the hippopotami and crocodiles<br />
down in its depths.</p>
<p>As far as the death of the first-born sons —<br />
“Get real,” he would say. “Let’s leave<br />
the kids alone. This is between adults.”<br />
Lots more: out in the wilderness<br />
he would arrange for some variety in food.<br />
He would not strike the rock<br />
and not forfeit his chance to see the Promised Land.<br />
Settling Canaan he would be equitable —<br />
would not massacre the Ammonites<br />
and the Amalekites. And when he died<br />
the place of his burial would be known<br />
so all could come and venerate his life.
</p>
<h4><i>Bayern-Sud</i></h4>
<p>The Monastery of the Hawks, where monks<br />
who looked like tankards brewed their fine black beer,<br />
set on a mountainside to keep away<br />
invaders, women, and the motley crew<br />
of non-religious, lingers in my mind<br />
not for the ages-old stone walls built up<br />
to shield the cenobites, nor the baroque<br />
chapel, not the shrines and not even<br />
the <i>Doppelbock</i> that helped them fast away<br />
long holy days, dark as the light down in<br />
the cellars where they stored it in huge casks<br />
six-hundred years in use, soaked with the dross<br />
of brewings kept two-hundred-thousand days —<br />
rather, the patchwork I could see from there:<br />
the squares of ripened barley, tawny; fields<br />
of purple bean-leaf, green rapunzel-plant;<br />
a quilt of autumnal variety,<br />
that rolled out to the distant Alps. One road<br />
stretched through it all, past farms with gardens where<br />
old kerchiefed women spread manure and where<br />
wood crucifixes (Jesus, white as snow,<br />
his head bowed sadly down) dotted the roads,<br />
commemorating accidents, sad spots<br />
where people died amid the silent pines.</p>
