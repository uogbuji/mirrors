		<h4>Begging</h4>
<p>My uncle’s scalp is split when Aunt Louise<br />
arrives and spits a warning round. The tire<br />
tool clanks down in my uncle’s blood. On his knees<br />
now Clayton Smallwood begs her not to fire.</p>
<p>She jams the barrel in between his eyes.<br />
“Get up!” she grumbles. He sweats drops of fear.<br />
His rises, leaves, but not before he tries<br />
his wicked tongue: “I curse your piss poor beer!“</p>
<p>Beneath this furious sun, beside her stone,<br />
her flower inundated casket brings<br />
to mind that night, the curse upon her Schlitz.</p>
<p>Then I spot Clayton, bald, a belly grown<br />
to watermelon girth. His cell phone rings;<br />
he whispers, in and out of sobbing fits.
</p>

<h4>The Measuring Hawk</h4>
<p>We parked to watch him navigate a pine,<br />
the power in his slow drop, wings wide spread.<br />
The forked limb, silhouetted in the sun<br />
tipped just above the evening’s foggy bed.</p>
<p>His call came out in echoings that sought<br />
to sway us: he was noble, but he was small,<br />
at fifty yards, a manager of heights<br />
who numbered rats and king snakes in his thrall.</p>
<p>Aiming his one shot .22, dad leaned<br />
on the blue hood. The perch the hawk was on<br />
forced me to squint; he was squarely in the sun.<br />
His craggy beak seemed cut from living stone.</p>
<p>My inward eye saw the shell rip his flesh,<br />
splitting his gristle, saw him drop, wings awry,<br />
crash through the prickly brush, hang there and flail,<br />
the steady, thrusting tongue till he would die.</p>
<p>I’d seen my big dogs gut-ripped, dead from wild cats<br />
that screamed at midnight but attacked at dawn,<br />
but I had not measured what I knew.<br />
What did I know of where their souls had gone?</p>
<p>The single shot cascaded through the woods.<br />
The bark flew, he started; then, he fled to air<br />
where he pumped hard, far beyond bullet range<br />
into such sunlight my vision could not bear.</p>
