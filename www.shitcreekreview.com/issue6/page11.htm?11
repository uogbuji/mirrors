<TABLE><TR><TD>
<br /> 
The traffic's four lanes thick.<br /> 
Half the drivers lip-synch into phones.<br /> 
Half drift home somnambulic.<br /> 
Bound, the cars creep, promising release<br /> 
like a belly dancer's beads<br /> 
 <br /> 
beetling towards her mons.<br /> 
I drum 'Perdido' on the steering wheel,<br /> 
glomming on the Voyager ahead.<br /> 
Does its driver shave his neck each week?<br /> 
Wow! He's just blown up<br /> 
 <br /> 
a jumbo gold balloon,<br /> 
tied a curly ribbon to it<br /> 
and finger-rolled it back into his van,<br /> 
where it floats like a yolk sac<br /> 
with its cord still attached.<br /> 
 <br /> 
Miracle: a hole opens left.<br /> 
I creep abreast of him<br /> 
as nine balloons jostle for the ceiling.<br /> 
He sucks a blast of helium himself<br /> 
then quacks at his dispatcher:<br /> 
 <br /> 
"Quit bugging me. Tell them that I'm trapped.<br /> 
As soon as I can slip this jam<br /> 
and squeeze into my pantyhose and wig,<br /> 
I'll sing their freakin' anthem like Joan Sutherland,<br /> 
rock them with my Hindenburg kabooms."<br /> 
 <br /> 
The voyager lifts above the road<br /> 
until his tires graze the roof<br /> 
of a Lexus just ahead.<br /> 
He breaks no laws except, perhaps,<br /> 
the certainty of jealousy:<br /> 
 <br /> 
cell phones drop from hands<br /> 
waving him godspeed, and waking eyes<br /> 
record a burst of memory<br /> 
as this intrepid pilot flips<br /> 
a kiss-stained tissue to the breeze. <br />
