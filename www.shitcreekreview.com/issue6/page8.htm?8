In winter, they fashion paradise <br />
in fancy wool. Multitudes make vows, <br />
horse-and-buggied in leather pews <br />
through the Eden of Central Park.<br />
<br />
Wait for evening white, innocent ones.<br />
<br />
Meet it there&#8212;where they look to liars, <br />
their blankets and their love, for warmth,<br />
for something to believe. <br />
The setting sun will show you <br />
truths they deny, how oaths <br />
are really taken in big cold cities. <br />
<br />
To know the frozen lowdown <br />
of this church you <br />
must descend, <br />
<br />
to prophets propped on corners, numb <br />
eyes upward with a distant grief, <br />
to apostles snoring in doorways, <br />
drooling penance, confessing <br />
weakness in white bursts,<br />
to women who men worship<br />
beneath the cross of their thighs.<br />
<br />
Legs are spread,<br />
hands are spread,<br />
knees are bruised,<br />
clouds of prayers<br />
dissipate in subway steam. <br />
<br />
Wait for night—and follow stained <br />
steps down to the echoes <br />
of dead faithful turning <br />
in their sleep. <br />
Descend, <br />
<br />
until you hear the scattered rattles <br />
of fallen angels, until you see souls <br />
scurry into tunnels chasing <br />
the sins of whispering snakes. <br />
<br />
Have they bled enough<br />
to forget the suffering,<br />
to long for it once more?<br />
Nothing captures religion better <br />
than temptation&#8212;it’s like the garden. <br />
There is a lure, a red offering, <br />
reminders you have teeth. <br />
And then a bite, a promise that <br />
even hell is temperate and green. <br />
