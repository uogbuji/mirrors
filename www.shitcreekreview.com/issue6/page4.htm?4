Remember, Lincoln Rep in sixty eight<br />
Had a young coltish company?  From those<br />
He flashed the winner; had a heavy nose<br />
<br />
But wild black hair, slim wrists.  Yes, at that date<br />
Realism raged.  Eggs sizzled every night.<br />
The candles blew the dugout maps alight.<br />
<br />
He slowed his dying, with a graceful hand<br />
Dangled from army blankets, while each flame<br />
Was beaten out.  Later, I heard his name<br />
<br />
Amongst the Sixth Form, heavy drinkers, tanned.<br />
One met him in a pub (no high-priced bar),<br />
‘Went out’.  He could, she yawned, play the guitar.<br />
<br />
I yearned for him.  But no, make light of this,<br />
Coach trips, dropped contact lenses, giggling friends,<br />
His Hamlet, fur cloak heaving at the end,<br />
<br />
As our provincial mothers glossed the Blitz.<br />
No corpse, failure or star, he has returned<br />
To small streets, Malvern’s hills, from the West End.<br />
<br />
Hair waves, dull grey.  The perfect cheeks are bone.<br />
Slim fingers, oddly tanned, flutter his throat.<br />
‘Musician’ adds a final programme note.<br />
<br />
We fade.  By my indifferent daughter’s side<br />
I watch him drift a spoon through scentless soup,<br />
Flushed with fatigue, duck from the curtain’s swoop,<br />
<br />
Spring to the old, fine actor by his side,<br />
Salute him, face a flash, a breath’s beat.  Wait,<br />
Did each map die to dust below the gilt<br />
In Lincoln Rep, in nineteen sixty-eight?<br />
<br />
