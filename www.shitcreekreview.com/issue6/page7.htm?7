<br />
I recognize my middle-age nostalgia<br />
for old rebellions. It’s human <br />
to cherish bravery later, after <br />
you’ve yanked the cornerstones <br />
of its beliefs. To admire<br /> 
on a shriveled road of compromise <br />
the swelling of a stubborn chest <br />
struggling through welcome hells, <br />
face to face with fire like the lord, <br />
searching for maps marked <br />
with the treasure of love. Now, <br />
<br />
it seems prudent to turn down <br />
the heat and suffer the penance <br />
of silence. I try to bury the bubbling <br />
in the froth of a Guinness, but <br />
by midnight ale makes me divine. <br />
I buy a round with my right hand <br />
and lecture a legion of lost angels  <br />
on the witness protection program <br />
of our souls. How we sold out<br />
<br />
for shelter, traitors to the crooked <br />
rain of our nature. We’re mascots <br />
for our cold feet, hiding <br />
in thin tents of affection, wandering <br />
the wasteland of fuck buddies <br />
who will never brew us the tea <br />
of comfort at nightfall or help pick <br />
tomorrow’s proper shoes. We pay <br />
<br />
for our sins in bad gravity, whirlpool <br />
with the romance of our youth. <br />
Providence always finds the drain <br />
in times of cowardice. We’ve lived <br />
in the thrillparks of fast delight, <br />
have become malignant charismatics<br />
like the kerosene drunks <br />
of the Depression, philosophizing <br />
on the black holes of our lives<br />
in the shadows of crumbling <br />
railway stations, skunked <br />
on dollar wine. We say <br />
<br />
things ain’t like they used to be,<br />
wear self-pity on our sleeves.<br />
In each word there’s a glory, <br />
in each glory a story. And when <br />
we say tomorrow we mean yesterday, <br />
and when we raise glasses <br />
we mean we’ll be brave <br />
again, but not today. Not today.<br />
