The boatman is surely a Dayak,<br>
a fact that is cinched by his dangling <br>
stretched earlobes resembling a chinstrap <br>
attached to his red plastic hard hat. <br>
<br>
The weights are long gone but the triton <br>
tattoos on his cheeks and his chest means <br>
he comes from a seafaring lineage, <br>
according to Gilbert M. Grosvenor. <br>
<br>
My wish list is way too ambitious&#8212;<br>
to spot an orang or a hornbill <br>
still living as nature intended <br>
in canopies shading the forest. <br>
<br>
The dugout canoe chuffles onward <br>
against the brown effluent, passing <br>
alluvial fans and arroyos&#8212;<br>
the colors of Texas in summer. <br>
<br>
A cluster or two of sick mangroves <br>
survives here and there as if planted <br>
to screen out a strip mining venture <br>
too ugly to meet regulations. <br>
<br>
I paid the man twenty-five ringgits <br>
to take me as far as the closest <br>
authentic old longhouse. His palm now <br>
demands that I give him more money. <br>
<br>
The journey I’d promised myself since <br>
I first saw the pictures of naked <br>
survivors who hid from the anschluss, <br>
escaping the pilgrims forever. <br>
<br>
At last I see trees, little patches <br>
of forest, in thickets and hammocks <br>
where logging is difficult. Skinny <br>
men down on their haunches and babbling, <br>
<br>
enjoying my presence by laughing <br>
and spitting out betel nut slobber <br>
through teeth that are stained a beet purple <br>
and staring through beady black eye-slits. <br>
<br>
Old woman. Aggressive expression. <br>
<i>So what in the world are you doing?</i> <br>
At least that is what I imagine <br>
she’s saying. I shrug back politely.<br>
