<br />
When the pleasure domes close down for the night<br />
we gather near the Magic Waterfall<br />
with hope the cloud of floating droplets might<br />
provoke another lucky dream, the kind<br />
our friend Delilah had that made her crawl<br />
inside a putrid open sewer pipe<br />
where she discovered lying right behind<br />
a mound of filthy rags the diamond ring<br />
of truth.  When she climbed out she smelled as ripe<br />
as moldy cheese, but smiled and wished us luck<br />
in our endeavors to secure a thing<br />
of beauty such as she had found.  It would<br />
not register till later that the muck<br />
which grimed the vampish dress and shoes she wore<br />
began to shimmer slightly as she stood<br />
there just before she drifted off.  The rest<br />
of us&#8212;the men and women both&#8212;all swore<br />
that never after did she show her face<br />
in old familiar nighttime places, dressed<br />
to kill.  And so the seething white cascade<br />
is where we spend our after-hours, to trace<br />
the path by which her charmed escape was made.<br />
