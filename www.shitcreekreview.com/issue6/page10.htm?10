My sister heard from them. The dead<br />
stood at the foot of her bed, leaned<br />
in doorways, lingered in the hall.<br />
Never done with earthly errands,<br />
endless business and pleasure trips,<br />
they often paused to whisper advice,<br />
deliver news, and offer tips.<br />
 <br />
Once, our father appeared, serene,<br />
boyish, beaming with an ease<br />
we'd never seen. He wore a new<br />
green parka and carried a ring of keys.<br />
And when she asked, he told her<br />
in a word what it was like: Travel,<br />
he said. He could go anywhere,<br />
and he was happy, so happy! To live<br />
the way he'd always wanted to live.<br />
<br />
 That's when she claimed to know,<br />
to understand. That's when she began<br />
to talk of destinations and departures.<br />
And her head was filled with plans:<br />
she'd travel light, forget her native<br />
language, learn to navigate at night,<br />
follow winding rivers, shifting sands.<br />
<br />
She studied charts and maps, spoke<br />
less and less, strained to hear voices<br />
in her dreams. She woke most days<br />
more focused on the road ahead.<br />
Take care of my babies, she said.<br />
The faraway look in her eyes<br />
made all my reasonable arguments<br />
sound more and more like lies.<br />
 <br />
I've heard no voices. No one<br />
has come to tell me what it's like.<br />
Dreams are just dreams, the usual<br />
still-life scenes, news I already know.<br />
I jingle my keys for the babies<br />
and think about where I want to go.<br />
<br />
