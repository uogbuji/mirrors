<h3>Submissions for the May, 2008 issue of <I>The Shit Creek Review</I></h3>

<b>Submissions for the May SCR now closed. Please wait until our next theme is announced in the May issue before sending new submissions.</b>

<P><del>Submissions for Issue #7 of <I>The Shit Creek Review</I> may be sent now.</del> The theme is <b>Masks</b>. </P>

<p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘It was the mask engaged your mind,<br>	 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after set your heart to beat,	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not what’s behind.’</i><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8212;W.B. Yeats<br>
<br>
Is there any poem that does <i>not</i> speak from behind some sort of mask? Yet your Mission for SCR 7 is to write poems that somehow, in anything from the most obvious to the most remotely unexpected ways, touch on or bounce off the concept of&#8212;<b>The Mask</b>! The poems may be written as if from behind a mask, as some kind of persona, or be written <i>about</i> masks, real or metaphoric, or written while actually wearing a mask, or... Look, we editors have not the faintest, foggiest notion of how you're going to achieve this. That's not our job. We are here simply to torment you into writing great poems for us. The usual terms and conditions apply (see below). Over to you!<br>
</p>
<b>Submissions for <i>The Shit Creek Review</i> May 2008 issue must be received by March 23rd, 2008.</b><br>
<br>
Possible submission routes (please read all the guidelines before submitting):<br><br>
<ul>
<li><b><font color="red">NEW!</font>&#8212;Online submission</b> via our <a href="http://www.shitcreekreview.com/submitonline.php">Shit Creek Magic Online Submission Form</a>&#8212;an easy way to submit if you’re just sending a poem or two without much, or complex, formatting. (You will receive an automated response showing your text as received.)</li><br>  
<li>Plain-text mail, if your text contains no significant formatting.</li><br> 
<li>Formatted (HTML) mail with your text in the body of the message. If necessary, you can copy into the message from a Word or other document.</li><br>
<li>Mail with an attached Word or RTF file. We recommend the attachment route for longer prose work or any work with complex formatting (indents, step breaks, lots of italics, and so on). Preferably, don’t send a Word file unless your virus-checker will scan it; save out as RTF and send that instead.</li><br></ul>

Again, Shit Creek Paddlers: we know it's not as much fun as partying: <b>but please read all the guidelines before submitting</b>. Other things being equal we are more likely to accept work that is easier for us to prepare for publication. 


<P>Artists can send image submissions to the Art Editor Don Zirilli (details below).</P>

<h3>General Submission Guidelines</h3></span>
<ol>
<li><i>The Shit Creek Review </i>will publish triannually in January, May, and  September/October, and seeks to present high-quality original work in the fields of poetry and art.<br>
  <br>
<li>Submission deadline dates and themes (if any) for the next issue will be specified in each current issue, but you may submit work at any time. If your submission is too late for the deadline date for one issue it will be placed in the batch for the next. But bear in mind that since most issues are themed it is sensible to submit work suitable for the relevant theme.  <br>
    <br>
<li>In poetry, we are biased towards formalism, but by no means dismissive of vers libre. We are looking for original work which deals with a wide variety of issues and imagery, including that which might test or challenge boundaries, or disturb sensibilities.  But it must be well executed. Please do not send us work which has not been extensively drafted, crafted and polished. <br><br>
<li>Previous publication is not a problem as long as the previous publisher does not hold copyright. You must inform us of any previous publication when you submit. Posting to blogs or online workshops is not in our opinion publishing, so any such poems or other pieces are clearly eligible. We reserve the right to archive your work as part of this site, and with your specific consent to publish it in a print anthology later; but all other rights remain with the author.<br><br>
<li>The person who submits work must be the original author.<br><br>
<li>We accept simultaneous submissions, but please inform us immediately if the submission is accepted elsewhere.<br><br>
<li>Poets should submit 1 - 5 poems. Contributions should be sent in the body of an email, or as .doc or .rtf file attachments if necessary to preserve formatting: text contributions, whether poetry or prose, should be single-spaced. <br><br>
<li>If you sent your submission in a .doc or .rtf file attachment, please name the file according to the following formula:
  <blockquote><p>
<b>Surname Title of The Poem.doc (or .rtf)</b><br></p>

<i>Example:</i>Yeats The Second Coming.doc</blockquote>

or, if more than one poem:<blockquote>
  <p>

<b>Surname Poems</b></p>
  <br>

<i>Example:</i>Yeats Poems.doc</blockquote>
This procedure is not mandatory but will make the editors' work a litttle easier.</li><br><br>
<li>Please include your surname and the word “Submission” in the subject line of your email, thus:<br>  
  <p><b>Yeats Submission</b><br>
  </p>
 <li><b>Do not</b> send us sound files unless requested to do so. If your work is selected for SCR we may invite you to contribute mp3 files of yourself reading it, but in that eventuality we will contact you.<br><br>
<li>Visual arts contributions should be as .jpeg files and may be sent as attachments. Image submissions should be original work or cite relevant permissions from copyright owners.<br><br>
<li>All contributors should include brief third person biographical details of up to five lines.<br><br> 
<li>We will attempt to acknowledge receipt of all submissions within four weeks of arrival, but cannot promise to do so.<br><br>
<li>Payment for publication in <i>The Shit Creek Review</i> is not possible in this life, but contributors will be rewarded in the next. On the other hand the editors are very receptive to offers (redeemable in this life) of cash bribes, vouchers, favours, and so forth.</ol>
