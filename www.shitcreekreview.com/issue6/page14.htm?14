<br /> 
After five hundred years who can pretend<br /> 

to know his reasons; motives are moot,<br /> 

and somebody has to be first to find a route,<br /> 

go round a world, or open a can of worms.<br /> 

 <br /> 

Oh we can talk about commercial advantage,<br /> 

of changing course to use the winds of change;<br /> 

or we can speculate on the need to prove<br /> 

things we already know&#8212;but what do we know<br /> 

 <br /> 

about joy, or of sailing away from Spain into<br /> 

unknown waters&#8212;what can we know  of such<br /> 

joy, we who can only speculate  on motives;<br /> 

who have never been first to go anywhere;<br /> 

 <br /> 

who think it’s enough to be told that five<br /> 

ships were reduced to one by mutiny, storm<br /> 

and starvation, and that he died before<br /> 

the journey's end? But what does that say<br /> 

 
<br /> 
of regret; or the earth turning under your<br /> 

bow; or that moment as everything changed,<br /> 

when you felt the waves lift you again;<br /> 

and a world slipped across your horizon.<br />
