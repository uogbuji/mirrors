Jenny Greenteeth sighs<br />
brackish bubbles, rippling the algae<br />
nimbus of her hair. She's leaner <br />
than in days when twiggy fingers <br />
more often snatched at flailing limbs,<br /> 
when arms would clasp<br />
the wriggling strays until they slept.<br />
Now  her pond-bed gasps with Koi, <br />
and all she cradles <br />
is an empty swell of rains. <br />
<br />
Rawhead-and-Bloody-Bones <br />
scratches cracked claws down <br />
his scabby ribs; gates have sprouted <br />
metal teeth, and yards are stalked <br />
at night by crop-eared beasts <br />
with jaws that put his own <br />
to shame. Flourescent lighting <br />
makes his nose bleed, whores <br />
and babies alike preserved <br />
behind its glaring rails. <br />
<br />
Boogey Man wibbles his fingers <br />
through duckweed, murmurs sympathy: <br />
parents now tell sugared fictions <br />
in which Darkness ever fails <br />
against the Light, the hope <br />
their children never know <br />
a killer's smile or alley-trap, <br />
the snap of toddlers breaking <br />
in their hands. <br />
<br />
The moon pales, sulks behind clouds. <br />
Jenny sinks below pond-scum. <br />
Boogey fishes brittle treats <br />
from his pocket for the restless Bones. <br />
Perhaps tonight they'll catch <br />
an ankle, wrack a fugue-dream, <br />
resurrect the notion of fear itself <br />
as prophylactic, the comfort <br />
of knowing something is still out there, <br />
looming in the dark.<br />
