Once upon a midnight movie, while I pondered bored and boozy,<br />
Over battles still adored by buffs of Rommel’s Nazi corps,<br />
While I guzzled, sometimes burping, suddenly there came a chirping,<br />
Like a smoke alarm was peeping, peeping underneath the floor.<br />
'`Tis a battery,' I sputtered, 'peeping underneath the floor&#8212;<br />
Only that, and nothing more.'<br />
<br />
How precisely I remember, when Montgomery must surrender<br />
As his dying tanks, dismembered, smoke as embers of the war,<br />
Meagerly, and to his sorrow, Rommel could not beg or borrow<br />
From the Reich’s supply of petrol—petrol for his plucky corps&#8212;<br />
<i>Für die Panzertruppen, daß der Führer nannt, 'mein schönstes Korps'</i>&#8212;<br />
(For the panzer units that the Fuehrer dubbed 'my finest corps'&#8212;)<br />
Now subtitles evermore.<br />
<br />
And the brilliant, frightful, certain shelling from the cordite curtain<br />
Thrilled me&#8212;filled me with explosive terrors never felt before;<br />
So that now, to still the pounding of my heart, I stood propounding,<br>
'Is a battery resounding warnings of a worn-out core?'<br />
Some weak battery resounding warnings of a worn-out core&#8212;<br />
Eveready, nevermore.<br />
<br />
Presently the movie ended; stridently I then extended<br />
Wider searches for the sniping that offended me before;<br />
But then I was almost sleeping when so gently you came bleeping,<br />
And so faintly you were peeping, peeping from my basement door,<br />
I was barely sure I heard you, so I opened wide the door.<br />
Darkness there, and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Deep into that darkness plunging, down the stairwell I went lunging,<br />
Censoring, expunging scenes no movie ever showed before.<br />
But the silence served a token of a smoke alarm unbroken<br />
And the only words there spoken were the slogan: 'No more war'<br />
This I murmured and my rumbling furnace answered: 'No more war!'<br />
Merely this and nothing more.<br />
<br />
An elixir for my body! I mixed up another toddy.<br />
Soon again I heard a chirping somewhat louder than before.<br />
'That’s not coming from the basement, could it be the window casement?<br />
Let me trace then whence it came from and this mystery explore.<br />
Let my heart be still an instant and this mystery explore;<br />
`Tis the window, nothing more!'<br />
<br />
Once I had the draperies parted, out a loathsome locust darted,<br />
Stopped and started, hopped and trotted underneath my large armoire.<br />
Blitzing cricket, lit by faded footage from the forties, traded<br />
Places safely underneath my entertainment center door&#8212;<br />
Disappeared beneath my stately entertainment center door&#8212;<br />
Disappeared and nothing more.<br />
<br />
In the second flick a pilot, short of gas on some small islet,<br />  
Tipped his sake to the warrior’s Kamikaze gods of yore;<br />
As the Nip flew on his mission, Little Boy released his fission&#8212;<br />
An obeisant city core was melted by the meteor.<br />  
Hiroshima and the encore&#8212;Nagasaki&#8212;were no more.<br />
Chirped the cricket, 'Nevermore.'<br />
<br />
Much I marvelled this ungainly insect heard the show so plainly,<br />
And the plaintiff set before me pled his case like Albert Gore;<br />
And, therefore, I came to notice this obnoxious talking locust<br />
Saw the trees before the forest and he seemed intent to bore.<br />
Cricket, locust&#8212;either name&#8212;alighting with intent to bore<br />
And bore the nickname 'Nevermore.'<br />
<br />
'Scientist', I said, 'what measure have you of our earthly treasure?<br />
From the data you’ve reported, little’s left of Gaia’s store;<br />
Tell this one of Hummer legions what crude seeps in polar regions&#8212;<br />
I’ll not stoop to solar power lest not one drop’s left to pour;<br />
Even then, bereft of sources, we can always go to war.'<br />
Quipped the cricket, ‘Nevermore!’<br />
<br />
'Be that writ of your remanding, bug or fiend!' I shrieked, commanding:<br />
'Search the seven seas for more oil from new platforms far off shore!<br />
Leave no black slick as a token of that lie your legs have spoken!<br />
Beg your buttocks not be bruised as you go strutting out the door!<br />
Take your rig from off my floor and figure where to drill for more!'<br />
Quipped the cricket, 'Nevermore.'<br />
<br />
And the cricket, never pumping, lies there crumpling, lies there crumpling<br />
On the carpet underneath my entertainment center door;<br />
Even now at this late hour, shadows of a drilling tower<br />
Cast from legs that, lacking power, cannot pump a barrel more;<br />
And my furnace, lying morbid by the sump beneath the floor,  <br />
Shall be fired&#8212;Nevermore!<br />
