Colin Flynn was never haughty,<br />
Always cheerful, but quite naughty:<br />
Colin was a fiend for pranking.<br />
Yet he never got a spanking.<br />
All the mischief he was brewing<br />
No one ever thought his doing.<br />
Colin’s act was so exquisite<br />
Mama sent him off to visit<br />
Her old mother at the cottage<br />
Gran now lived in in her dotage.<br />
Granny had an ancient parrot<br />
Anything you said would scare it.<br />
It would cry, whenever nervous,<br />
"Heaven help us! Saints preserve us!"<br />
Sitting on its perch a-swinging,<br />
With its cage bell gaily ringing.<br />
When the parrot squawked so loudly<br />
Granny beamed, announcing proudly,<br />
"My ma told me her ma told ’er<br />
This old parrot is much older<br />
Than this village. Polly’s shabby,<br />
But he hatched inside an abbey<br />
Long since vanished and forgotten<br />
With its monks, now dead and rotten.<br />
But he heard their daily praying&#8212;<br />
Thus he learned his clever saying.<br />
Isn’t my old bird amazing?"<br />
<br />
Colin thought of better phrasing<br />
And of words more worth repeating,<br />
Phrases that would earn a beating<br />
With a birch twig for his fanny<br />
Were he saying them to granny&#8212;<br />
Yet were Polly to repeat them<br />
Granny would not ever beat them...<br />
Every day when gran went shopping<br />
Colin set the bird a-hopping<br />
Teased it like an evil jailor<br />
While he swore just like a sailor.<br />
Still the bird cried holy service:<br />
"Heaven help us! Saints preserve us!"<br />
Bouncing ’bout at every angle<br />
While its bell went jingle-jangle.<br />
Colin, though, was not dissuaded.<br />
All the more the boy degraded<br />
Poor old Poll with insults fouler<br />
’Bout its mother and an owler,<br />
Poked the parrot with his finger.<br />
Once he let the digit linger<br />
Too long ’fore the angry parrot<br />
So it bit it, like a carrot.<br />
"Bloody Hell!" yelled little Colin<br />
Once this mishap had befallen.<br />
"Bloody Hell! Oh damn, I’m bleeding!"<br />
Drops of red were quickly beading<br />
Dripping down from bite to tiling.<br />
Colin soon began reviling<br />
Granny’s parrot. Then it quoted,<br />
"‘Bloody Hell!’" like one devoted.<br />
<br />
"What was that?" the boy inquired.<br />
Good old Polly was inspired:<br />
"Bloody Hell!" it started squawking,<br />
"Bloody Hell!" its perch a-rocking.<br />
Colin cried out in elation,<br />
Then the bird made invocation:<br />
"By this blood I summon Hell now.<br />
Demons come! I ring the bell now!"<br />
Gave its bell a gentle jingle.<br />
Colin felt his neck hairs tingle.<br />
Polly’s eyes were mad and manic.<br />
Those dead monks had been Satanic!<br />
"Astaroth, Marbas, Pazuzu!<br />
Ophis, Asmoday, Lilitu!<br />
Belfregor!" it called out, hanging<br />
Upside-down, bell gaily clanging.<br />
"Valefor, Abraxas, Amon!<br />
Barbatos, Eligos, Mammon!<br />
All ye snakes that slink and slither<br />
Hearken now and come ye hither!"<br />
Bloody tiles started smoking<br />
At the parrot’s foul invoking.<br />
Thirteen fiends, with claws and scales,<br />
Slithered forth, their horns and tails<br />
Barbed and forked and slowly swishing.<br />
Colin stood there. He was wishing<br />
He’d been kinder to the birdy.<br />
Poll squawked like a hurdy-gurdy,<br />
"Hellish Legions, heed my urgin’&#8212;<br />
Look, I offer you this virgin!<br />
For your honor and your pleasure!<br />
You may eat it at your leisure!"<br />
All the angels, dark and fallen,<br />
Took their claws and seized poor Colin.<br />
One, with fangs like alabaster:<br />
"What is your command, oh master?"<br />
Gran’s bird looked to one much blacker<br />
And said, "Polly wanna cracker!"<br />
With a smile and fiendish chuckles,<br />
And a crack of blackened knuckles,<br />
In a flash, it conjured kibble<br />
Which the bird began to nibble.<br />
"As you wish, oh wisest magus.<br />
If you want another, page us."<br />
Polly nodded. "You may serve us."<br />
Then he chuckled. "Saints preserve us!<br />
Heaven help us!" Polly prated.<br />
Colin realized, belated,<br />
That these words of sweet repentance<br />
Were some dead monk’s final sentence,<br />
For the demons screamed, impassioned,<br />
At the banishment so fashioned<br />
By this holy admonition<br />
As they vanished to Perdition<br />
With a clap of thunder cracking,<br />
Colin taken too, for snacking.<br />
<br />
Gran, returning, stopped and wondered<br />
Where her grandson could have blundered,<br />
‘Where’s my Colin? Tell me, Polly!"<br />
"Bloody Hell!" her bird cried, jolly.<br />
"Bloody Hell!" The bird swung gaily.<br />
"Bloody Hell!" It said this daily.<br />
