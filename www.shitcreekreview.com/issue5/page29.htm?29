<br>
<blockquote><b>The Second Coming </b><br />
<br />
Turning and turning in the widening gyre <br />
The falcon cannot hear the falconer; <br />
Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold; <br />
Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world, <br />
The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere <br />
The ceremony of innocence is drowned; <br />
The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br />
Are full of passionate intensity.<br />
<br />
Surely some revelation is at hand; <br />
Surely the Second Coming is at hand. <br />
The Second Coming! Hardly are those words out <br />
When a vast image out of Spiritus Mundi <br />
Troubles my sight: somewhere in sands of the desert <br />
A shape with lion body and the head of a man, <br />
A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun, <br />
Is moving its slow thighs, while all about it <br />
Reel shadows of the indignant desert birds. <br />
The darkness drops again; but now I know <br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep <br />
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle, <br />
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, <br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born? <br />
<br /><br />
<b>The Hawk in the Rain</b><br />
<br />
I drown in the drumming ploughland, I drag up <br />
Heel after heel from the swallowing of the earth’s mouth, <br />
From clay that clutches my each step to the ankle <br />
With the habit of the dogged grave, but the hawk <br />
<br />
Effortlessly at height hangs his still eye. <br />
His wings hold all creation in a weightless quiet, <br />
Steady as a hallucination in the streaming air. <br />
While banging wind kills these stubborn hedges, <br />
<br />
Thumbs my eyes, throws my breath, tackles my heart, <br />
And rain hacks my head to the bone, the hawk hangs <br />
The diamond point of will that polestars <br />
The sea drowner’s endurance: and I, <br />
<br />
Bloodily grabbed dazed last-moment-counting <br />
Morsel in the earth’s mouth, strain towards the master- <br />
Fulcrum of violence where the hawk hangs still. <br />
That maybe in his own time meets the weather <br />
<br />
Coming the wrong way, suffers the air, hurled upside down, <br />
Fall from his eye, the ponderous shires crash on him, <br />
The horizon traps him; the round angelic eye <br />
Smashed, mix his heart’s blood with the mire of the land.<br /></blockquote>
<br />
<br />
The following brief comparative analysis of “The Hawk in the Rain” (1957) by Ted Hughes and “The Second Coming” (1920) by W. B. Yeats can be taken as a strong indication that Hughes was deliberately adapting the images and theme of Yeats’ poem. Although this is not my main concern here, additional evidence of this can be seen in the fact that Hughes employs images used by Yeats elsewhere, most noticeably at the end of his poem, where “the dolphin’s mire and blood” in Yeats’ poem, “Byzantium” is adapted to: “…mix his heart’s blood with the mire of the land.”<br /><br />
 Both poems are concerned with a vision of horror, a vision of Doomsday, but there is a significant difference in what is seen as constituting world order. For Yeats it is apparently society and civilisation; for Hughes it is the natural world. My analysis will show, however, that both poets contradict their professed alliances, and that the poems are testimony both to profound ambivalence and to a deeper alliance.<br />
<br />
In the first stanza of “The Second Coming” Yeats appeals to the intellect to save humanity, scorning the passions of the heart:<br />

<blockquote>The best lack all conviction, while the worst <br />
Are full of passionate intensity.</blockquote>

But in the second stanza the vision of the Sphinx can be seen as a metaphor for Yeats attempting to yoke together the contradictory impulses of the head and the heart, and it is his emotions that prove to be the stronger:<br />
<blockquote>…but now I know <br />
That twenty centuries of stony sleep <br />
Were vexed to nightmare by a rocking cradle…,</blockquote>

This is an emotional conviction, and one which has vexed critics as to its meaning.
In the poem’s conclusion, Yeats calls upon the tatters of his intellect to rescue him:<blockquote>
And what rough beast, its hour come round at last, <br />
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?</blockquote>

But this is hardly the conclusion of the intellect alone. It is Yeats’ emotions that have supplied the horror, and the intellect has been called in to rationalise it afterwards. So while Yeats professes to champion his head over his heart, it is his heart that would seem to be the key to his poetic impulse.<br />
<br />
Where Yeats’ poem has a falcon and a falconer, Hughes’ poem, “The Hawk in the Rain”, has a hawk and an I-narrator. The narrator identifies with images of earth and water, thus emphasising his emotional connection to the world.<br /><br />
  The hawk is, however, an ambivalent symbol here inasmuch as it seemingly defies natural laws, yet finally succumbs to them. Thus, for Hughes, the hawk symbolises both culture and nature, both the head and the heart. The hawk can be seen as a parallel to the Sphinx, and here the battle between the head and the heart is overtly stated at the outset. This battle comes to a climax in the penultimate stanza:<blockquote>
Bloodily grabbed dazed last-moment-counting <br />
Morsel in the earth’s mouth, strain towards the master- <br />
Fulcrum of violence where the hawk hangs still.</blockquote>
Then, by a leap of imagination, Hughes paints the horror of the hawk’s downfall, thus revealing that his poetic vision of horror is an intellectual one:<blockquote>
That maybe in his own time meets the weather…</blockquote>
And just as Yeats drew on his intellect to produce his final image, so Hughes draws on his ragged emotions for his:<blockquote>
Coming the wrong way, suffers the air, hurled upside down, <br />
Fall from his eye, the ponderous shires crash on him, <br />
The horizon traps him; the round angelic eye <br />
Smashed, mix his heart’s blood with the mire of the land.</blockquote>
The premise for the description of the hawk’s demise is a photographic clarity that belongs to the sphere of the intellect, even though it is the poet’s emotions that supply the diction that constitutes the poetic effect. <br />
<br />
The analysis above suggests that visionary poets have an alter ego that is at odds with their ego, and that it is this alter ego that is the deeper inspiration for their poetry. As Yeats himself wrote: “We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.” <br />
