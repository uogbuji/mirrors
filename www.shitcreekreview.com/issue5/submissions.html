<ol>
<li><i>The Shit Creek Review </i>will publish triannually in January, May, and  September/October, and seeks to present high-quality original work in the fields of poetry and art.<br>
  <br>
<li>Submission deadline dates and themes (if any) for the next issue will be specified in each current issue, but you may submit work at any time. If your submission is too late for the deadline date for one issue it will be placed in the batch for the next.<br>
    <br>
<li>In poetry, we are biased towards formalism, but by no means dismissive of vers libre. We are looking for original work which deals with a wide variety of issues and imagery, including that which might test or challenge boundaries, or disturb sensibilities.  But it must be well executed. Please do not send us work which has not been extensively drafted, crafted and polished. <br><br>
<li>Previous publication is not a problem as long as the previous publisher does not hold copyright. You must inform us of any previous publication when you submit. Posting to blogs or online workshops is not in our opinion publishing, so any such poems or other pieces are clearly eligible. We reserve the right to archive your work as part of this site, and with your specific consent to publish it in a print anthology later; but all other rights remain with the author.<br><br>
<li>The person who submits work must be the original author.<br><br>
<li>We accept simultaneous submissions, but please inform us immediately if the submission is accepted elsewhere.<br><br>
<li>Poets should submit 1 - 5 poems. Contributions should be sent in the body of an email, or as .doc or .rtf file attachments if necessary to preserve formatting: text contributions, whether poetry or prose, should be single-spaced. <br><br>
<li>If you sent your submission in a .doc or .rtf file attachment, please name the file according to the following formula:
  <blockquote><p>
<b>Surname Title of The Poem.doc (or .rtf)</b><br></p>

<i>Example:</i>Yeats The Second Coming.doc</blockquote>

or, if more than one poem:<blockquote>
  <p>

<b>Surname Poems</b></p>
  <br>

<i>Example:</i>Yeats Poems.doc</blockquote>
This procedure is not mandatory but will make the editors' work a litttle easier.</li><br><br>
<li>Please include your surname and the word “Submission” in the subject line of your email, thus:<br>  
  <p><b>Yeats Submission</b><br>
  </p>
  
<li>Visual arts contributions should be as .jpeg files and may be sent as attachments. Image submissions should be original work or cite relevant permissions from copyright owners.<br><br>
<li>All contributors should include brief third person biographical details of up to five lines.<br><br> 
<li>We will attempt to acknowledge receipt of all submissions within three weeks of arrival.<br><br>
<li>Payment for publication in <i>The Shit Creek Review</i> is not possible in this life, but contributors will be rewarded in the next. On the other hand the editors are very receptive to offers (redeemable in this life) of cash bribes, vouchers, favours, and so forth.</ol>
