 <br />
On the barn's rough skin,  <br />
it's a spider-coffin  <br />
cradle for a young dirt-dauber.  <br />
 <br />
I would have thatched your arm with it  <br />
had you lived to be stung.  <br />
What your eyes would have become  <br />
had they seen the world.  <br />
 <br />
Old Miss Talcum, she rejuvenates  <br />
with it. Says, "It's what all  <br />
good Christians is made of,"  <br />
and says it just that way,  <br />
like words and I have never met.  <br />
 <br />
Makes me think of that back road  <br />
night, those boys chasing him and me.  <br />
How he was too smart, losing them  <br />
along the creek. How good it felt  <br />
between my toes. Things  <br />
you won't, ever, know.  <br />
 <br />
That other time, in town,  <br />
at the sculpting school, posing  <br />
on a stool for money.  <br />
And that tall one said I was  <br />
the perfect shade.  <br />
 <br />
I sometimes wonder,  <br />
would like to see what he made  <br />
of his smile and his words,  <br />
if he's a true man.  <br />
 <br />
It's useful for all sorts of things;  <br />
even keeps wind  <br />
out of this old cabin some days,  <br />
but it's the wrong thing for a grave.  <br />
I told him, but he's out there, now,  <br />
uprooting the garden  <br />
with his hands. Making you  <br />
the best home he can. <br />
