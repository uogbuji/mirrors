<br>
You began right in front of me today. <br />
I don’t know where you came from, <br />
patient muscles hanging loose in your <br />
soil-painted, dark-blue suit coat, <br />
one pocket ripped to a triangle, <br />
one pocket stuffed oh so properly <br />
with a coffee-filled paper-wrapped <br />
pint bottle, your thin legs nailed down <br />
into a pair of the saddest brown pants, <br />
a long-handle spade extending your arms, <br />
eyes folded over reaching for noon. <br />
<br />
Off behind you, faded to gray, <br />
jetted the rip of animate steam, <br />
coal gases; railroad track arrowing <br />
in a lake top that still does not exist. <br />
<br />
You said, “Manja,” and laughed at me, <br />
your big teeth ripe of red meat and bread, <br />
voice as loud as your hands slapping with music. <br />
<br />
You untied the red bandanna at your neck, <br />
a sun-bothered sail of red bandanna, <br />
wiped the brow under a felt hat, sucked <br />
at the papered bottle until I tasted iodine <br />
at the bend of my throat, smelled coal dust <br />
coming a talc over us, like a dry fog. <br />
<br />
It was the same yesterday when I made <br />
a v-grooved pole to hold the clothesline up, <br />
and over the fence a visitor from the Maritimes <br />
said, “You go back a long way. I haven’t seen <br />
a pole like that in  years and years.” <br />
<br />
So I guess you came the way the pole did, <br />
out of the roads I’ve traveled, down lanes <br />
stuffed like chairs, past yard geographies, <br />
a long view over trees, out of some <br />
thing I was, an organic of memory, <br />
celluloid flashing of  wide spaces <br />
I passed through, the odors I thought <br />
I wore or was, cannons at the edge <br />
of a distant war, colors banging <br />
their permanence tightly against <br />
the back of my eyes, <br />
<br />
pieces of the circle I find myself on, <br />
where you were a moment ago, just <br />
out the window of my mind, bearing <br />
the riddle of a melancholy whistle.<br />
