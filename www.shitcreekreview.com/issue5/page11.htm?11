  <br />
  ’Twas on the 29th of September 1902, be it told,<br />
That I, the poet McGonagall, who had grown old, <br />
Departed the earthly life, and was said<br />
By the attending doctor and others to be certainly dead.<br />
Aye, in the world of flesh I no longer did linger,<br />
And was quite unable to move so much as a finger.<br />
<br />
But I am not at all sure that I can explain to ye<br />
How it really is, no longer alive to be.<br />
<br />
At first I could not fathom the reason at all<br />
Why I was handled so, and wrapped in a pall.<br />
I could not move, not a finger nor toe, nor head.<br />
I had not yet understood that I was dead<br />
Due to me being quite aware of all this,<br />
Although stricken, it seemed, with paralysis.<br />
<br />
Once I had grasped that I was actually dead<br />
I was in the greatest fear as to what lay ahead.<br />
My friends, it was a fright indeed when I did see <br />
That soon in a coffin in the ground I would be!<br />
For although I was quite incapable of moving, <br />
Or calling out, I was aware of everything! <br />
<br />
To those who’ve doggedly in life opined<br />
That Mind is no more than Brain, and Brain is Mind&#8212;<br />
Oh what a shock when Mind must face dead Brain!<br />
You cannot move, yet feel the body’s pain.<br />  
You are a bound spectator, so to say; <br />
You feel the pain, helpless to tear yourself away. <br />
<br />
The <i>rigor mortis</i> is extremely cruel of pain,<br />
A cramp of the body entire which does remain.<br />
And oh, my friends, ’tis an awful thing to know<br />
That into the ground your body is soon to go<br />
And your mind perforce is doomed to stay with it there<br />
For longer years than a mind has strength to bear.<br />
<br />
But I am not at all sure that I can explain to ye<br />
How it really is, no longer alive to be.<br />
<br />
Your mind is trapped in the grave until your cadaver<br />
Has rotted to bits, with very little left over.<br />
After twenty years or so, the skull falls from the neck, <br />
And after that you can sometimes take a short break<br />
To go off a-haunting, a skill that requires learning,<br />
Which isn’t easy, and soon you must be returning.<br />
<br />
The mind can grow another fifty or sixty years old<br />
Waiting for freedom, the more so in lands where it is cold.<br />
If you must be buried, choose a place that is hot;<br />
For the hotter the ground, the faster your remains will rot.<br />
To be shut up eighty years with your corpse is bad,<br />
Which is the reason many a mind emerges mad.<br />
<br />
In recent times I have at last met the Queen;<br />
Victoria, of course, is the one that I mean. <br />
Her death occurred only the year before mine<br />
And her spirit, too, was buried for a very long time.<br />
To promote cremation the Queen’s own surgeon tried,<br />
Still his views did not prevail when she herself died.<br />
<br />
The Queen did not go mad in her coffin, be it said,<br />
For she was a little mad before she was dead.<br />
Strangely, the minds that best succeed to survive<br />
Belong to those (and I am one) who when alive<br />
Appeared somewhat deranged already&#8212;so with the Queen, <br />
Whose spirit, I must remark, is lovely to be seen.<br />
<br />
But I am not at all sure that I can explain to ye<br />
How it really is, no longer alive to be.<br />
<br />
The many who seem sanest in the world’s eye,<br />
Often do not remain so for long after they die,<br />
For the grave is a cruel gaol for a mind that would be free,<br />
And I can speak of this, which certainly happened to me,<br />
Although, God be thanked, I declined to go insane<br />
During all those years when I underground did remain.<br />
<br />
Down in the grave I bitterly did curse<br />
To think my fate could scarcely have been worse.<br />
Surely had I only arranged to be cremated,<br />
My progress would have been greatly accelerated.<br />
Eighty years sooner I should have reached the Beyond,<br />
Instead of spending those years underground.<br />
<br />
But a worse fate, I now know, when you’ve died,<br />
Is to end up being embalmed or mummified.<br />
So Tutankhamun has told me, who was doomed<br />
To be embalmed and mummified and entombed.<br />
He would have forsworn the riches of Egyptian royalty<br />
To avoid the centuries-long waiting and the horrid indignity. <br />
<br />
Embalming and mummifying is, it must be said,<br />
The most terrible treatment one can receive when dead.<br />
The corpse, or its owner’s mind, does indeed know pain,<br />
Which is a fact I must emphasise to ye again,<br />
And for the mind it is a matter of great gravity<br />
To feel the organs being removed from the body cavity.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but the embalmers give more pain<br />
Breaking a bone behind the nose to reach the brain.<br />
With instruments they cut it up very finely, no doubt,<br />
Then through the nostrils they do suck it out. <br />
Imagine the cold embalming tools and all of this<br />
While you are gripped in a profound paralysis.<br />
<br />
But I am not at all sure that I can explain to ye<br />
How it really is, no longer alive to be.<br />
<br />
When under the ground, I lamented bitterly<br />
To think how the fire would have set me free.<br />
In my spooking breaks, I was moved by grass of green,<br />
But a crematory was most beautiful to be seen<br />
Because it allows you to move on with little delay <br />
Instead of being under the ground for many a day.<br />
<br />
In closing I earnestly urge ye not to be buried;<br />
Ye should see to it that your moving on is hurried.<br />
Don’t spend another lifespan in the cemetery, <br />
Choose a short though painful time in the crematory.<br />
From my own experience I have certainly learned<br />
That it would have been far better to be burned.<br />
<br />
But I am not at all sure that I can explain to ye<br />
How it really is, no longer alive to be.<br />

<div align="left"><i>Notes by William McGonagall III</i><br /><br />
My great-grandfather appeared to me recently in a dream. The apparition bore a likeness to the extant images of William Topaz McGonagall, and the entire experience was of so strikingly realistic a character as to convince me that this was indeed a genuine manifestation of my great-grandfather's spirit.  He spoke to me (his accent rather “Morningside”) and said he had a poem he wished published “as widely as may be”.  He then began reciting, or dictating, the above lines. I interrupted the old fox after the first stanza to tell him I was on to him, that I knew he had fooled us to the top of his bent  (to use an expression of the time) while living, and that he might feel free to speak now with his true voice. But he wouldn’t hear of it. “No, no. For fear of not catching enough attention, I have composed these lines in the manner that the people know and expect of me,” he said, “or approximately so, since the grave does change a man.” Awakening from this dream, I found myself easily able to recall and write down all 118 lines. I have edited them a little, removing some material which I considered not quite apropos&#8212;for example, a stanza towards the end which began, “Perhaps for now I have nearly said enough. / Another time I might report on God and stuff.”
