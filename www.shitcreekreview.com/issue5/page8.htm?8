Spring fell all over me this year in a flurry of scattered miles,<br />
Driving back and forth across three states, thumbing through<br />
 <br />
my mind for words to say as my brother sits by his wife,<br />
my help nothing more than a thin slice of light across the floor.<br />
 <br />
On the first visit she sits up, talks about the jazz her son plays,<br />
big name venues, the shuffle and shift it took to cover her classes.<br />
 <br />
She wears a wig, lipstick, watches the news on a miniature<br />
TV, keeps up with things, makes lists, even speaks<br />
 <br />
long distance on the telephone.  After two weeks I return to find<br />
her pressing my brother to buy hanging flowers for the porch,<br />
 <br />
fuchsia, though she can’t name the bloom.  She doesn’t sit now,<br />
talks through the muffled gray of drugs, shuns visitors, so I<br />
 <br />
wait fretfully with my brother for the ringing of her bell.<br />
Mostly she sleeps, caught in a wedge of covers.  He carries the thin<br />
 <br />
stick, stiff memories, in halting steps to the bathroom.  She avoids<br />
the mirror,  slips into a room that holds little light.<br />
 <br />
Rain comes the last time and I enter the house with mud on my shoes.<br />
Eggshell quiet.  No sign of anyone.  Upstairs when I see her<br />
 <br />
lying on her side, she turns slightly, barely lifts her lips to smile. <br />
Her head wrapped turban style, the grief gone from her, breathing<br />
 <br />
remains.  Watching drops across the pane, my brother stacks unopened mail,<br />
cracks tins to feed the cat, eats food lifted from bone white paper sacks.<br /><br />
