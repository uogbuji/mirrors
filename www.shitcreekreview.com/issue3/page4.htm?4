<P>The Lord our God, the Lord is wise, our God is great;<BR>
our only God, attend our cries that God is great! </P>

<P>We honor and submit to thee, with heads bowed low;<BR>
on hands and knees, we recognize that God is great! </P>

<P>The meadows bloom, the rivers flood and oceans flow;<BR>
the sun and moon forever rise, for God is great! </P>

<P>Pay homage to His might; be certain that you go<BR>
before him in a humble guise, for God is great! </P>

<P>Obey the Lord, defend the Lord, observe His word;<BR>
resist the sinner who denies that God is great! </P>

<P>Be most severe when heresy is overheard<BR>
until the disbeliever sighs that God is great! </P>

<P>Enforce the Laws of God as strictly as you can;<BR>
and scourge and burn the one who lies, for God is great! </P>

<P>When God is mocked or disobeyed, a righteous  man<BR>
tears out offending tongues and eyes, for God is great! </P>

<P>The armies of the Lord are vast; our hosts increase;<BR>
our voices rise up to the skies: our God is great! </P>

<P>Know ye, our enemies, that God is Lord of peace;<BR>
but He shall never compromise, for God is great! </P>

<P>Whatever happens, let it be, it is God’s plan;<BR>
and he who acts against Him dies, for God is great! </P>

<P>To die for God is not to die, but to ascend;<BR>
if all men die it testifies that God is great! </P>

<P>The Lord our God, our God is wise, God is the end; <BR>
and now a final cantor cries that God is great!</P></td>
