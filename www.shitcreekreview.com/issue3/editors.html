<h2>The Plywood Canoe</h2><p></p>
<br><table width="100%"><tr><td>
<P>Welcome to the Plywood Canoe! This is the first-ever poetry ezine branded onto plywood with a woodburner. And here we are, heading up Shit Creek again, boldly seeking more quagmires to flounder about in.  Never satisfied with more than enough trouble, we have added to our woes by initiating a zine-within-a-zine, a subzine, a parasitic growth upon the body poetic of <I>SCR</I>, an entity labelled<I> &quot;</I><B>II&quot;</B>. Yes, <I>The Shit Creek Review</I> has laboured and strained, and out has popped <B>II</B> - pronounced &quot;Two&quot; or &quot;Too&quot; or &quot;To&quot; or &quot;Number Two&quot; or &quot;Eye-Eye&quot; or &quot;Aye-Aye&quot;, or &quot;I and I&quot;, or what you will. But probably &quot;Two&quot;. </P>

<P><B>II</b>’s function is to provide an area of focus within the vaster free-range swamp of <I>The Shit Creek Review</I>; and so for example our inaugural <B>II</B> features the American poet Timothy Murphy, with a miniature treasure-trove of new poems by Tim, essays on him, and selections from his unpublished prosimetrum memoirs, <I>Requited</I>. We’ve even talked a few of his friends into sharing with us what Tim is <I>really</I> like up close and personal. Hair-raising stuff. You’d better get over to<B> II</B> and check it out – after you finish reading this editorial, of course. Click on the big <b>II</b> on the front cover of this issue. </P>

<P>In future issues of<B> II</B> we hope to feature other poets, Australian and British, as well as American, or any others that write in English. Today, Fargo, tomorrow, the World! But we also intend to focus on other areas as well, such as on themes for poets to write to. Our next issue of <B>II</B>, bundled into <I>The Shit Creek Review</I>, will be devoted to poems with a biographical bent, loosely interpreted; poems about Lives. See our Submissions page for more details. </P>

<P>Innovations keep surging into the Canoe of Poesy. Here’s another one: <I>SCR</I> is switching from Bi-monthly to Quarterly publication. This issue was held back to help synchronise that switch: we’ll publish in July, October, January and April. We won’t call them Summer, Autumn, Winter and Spring editions though, because many of us are Southern Hemisphereans of the Antipodean persuasion, and we would become very disoriented under such a reversed seasonal nomenclature. <I>SCR </I>is making this switch because the work involved in getting <I>SCR </I>(now<I>+</I><B>II</B> ) out every two months was leading to marriage breakdowns, fugue-states, delirium, loss of sanity and motor-function, and so forth. Think of us as basically lazy workaholics. </P>

<P>More innovation: we’re experimenting with editorial procedure, and beginning with this issue, the elite Poetry Editors (Nigel and myself) are generously allowing the Art Editor (Don) and Artist-in-Residence (Pat) to make the Artist’s Choice: they get to choose one poem a piece to go into  <I>SCR</I>, and to tell us all why they chose it. As compensation for this noble surrender of  power, Nigel and I will also pick a stand-out poem each from the current crop: so four poems each issue will receive special recognition – not for being superior to the others, but for particularly appealing to one or other of the editors in various ways. All bribes to the Shit Creek Anti-Corruption Committee please. </P>

<P>There you have it, then. Awash with innovations! A parasitic subzine, a devious avoidance of extra work, a switch to Quarterly, and new avenues for bribery for Editor’s Special Picks. Where the bloody hell can the canoe go from here?</P><p>

<P>Editors' Picks</P>

</B><P><B>Pat: </b>I’m picking Angela's "Wayland Smith". I remember fondly the first time I saw the chalk horse.  This poem takes me back to that memory, back home to a country that I am certain I was born in, if not in this life, in a life before.  I respond to many of Angela's poems in this way.  Her words and imagery always touch and inspire me... to make art, book a ticket to England or both... always hoping for the call of a horn, or the demand of a hoofbeat to lead me.</P>

<p><B>Don:</b> Dave McClure&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Pessimistic Ballade of Arbitrary Behaviour&rdquo; has a timeless, authorless quality. In other words, it strikes me as a traditional or &ldquo;folk&rdquo; poem. The seriousness, wisdom and tautology of the repeating line &ldquo;for people do as people will&rdquo; balances the levity in the rest. I am sent vibrating between two extremes as I read: doggerel on one side and profundity on the other. I am won over by the poem because it never decides between the two.</P>


<P><b>Nigel: </B>Brian Dion’s &quot;A Smuggler in the Chancery&quot; is my pick. A great sonnet that in its sad defiance and pride in an already lost language is a melancholy Canute which sits within the waves that have already consumed it.</P>

<P><b>Paul: </B>Danielle Lapidoth's "The Fight" does it for me. So many aspects of this poem get it just right. It deals with a volatile, dangerous topic, yet keeps the subject under tight control through superb manipulation of form. The sounds in this are so taut and closely-bound, so precise: form and sound enact the barely-controlled intoxication of rage. The tension between subject and form is palpable.</P>
