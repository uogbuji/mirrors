Artistry and craft glow from every piece that nestles<br>
inside the chests in the cottage under the White Horse;<br>
celestial against midnight blue, dazzle against dark.<br>
They come for miles, the well heeled and the well off,<br>
nouveau or old money, the dot-coms and the county<br>
to try their influence at his studded door.<br><br>

The door opens for every supplicant and he looks.<br>
Some gush and fawn, some demand, some plead<br>
but all fall into silence under his metalled gaze<br>
and only get a glimpse of the dark room behind him;<br>
the tumbled cot and the willow twigs ribbed with rings,<br>
before he sighs and closes the door against them.<br>
<br>
Rarely does his assaying stare meet an alloy he approves,<br>
rarely does he give a sharp nod and turn to limp to his bench<br>
leaving them to follow. The few who win his nod never speak<br>
of what they see; never tell of choices made, whether for them<br>
or by them. They never comment when others exclaim<br>
‘Oh! You have a Wayland Smith!’  but only dip their heads<br>
as though they wear a scar, not a jewel.<br>
<br>
Dusk falls under the White Horse and the old man stands<br>
to watch the sky, the work on his bench forgotten. He sees<br>
nothing but the hope of a silhouette against the sunset,<br>
hears nothing but the anticipation of a wing’s whisper.<br>
Only when the night has fully settled on the hills<br>
does his head drop and he turns to the cottage,<br>
there to lie down in his leather apron; always waiting<br>
for the call of a horn, or the demand of a hoofbeat.<br>
