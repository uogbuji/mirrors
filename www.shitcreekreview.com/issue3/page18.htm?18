Nathaniel thought the way ahead<br>
was clear. He looked at Clementine<br>
(a silly name) and softly said<br>
"My only love, will you be mine?<br>
A word, a nod, a glance, a sign<br>
that I'm your Jack and you're my Jill?"<br>
But then he swallowed turpentine <br>
for people do as people will.<br>
<br>
She laid him on her mother's bed.<br>
(Her dad had gone to Lichtenstein<br>
in search of mirth and maidenhead,<br>
which some considered out of line.)<br>
She called the priest at ten to nine. <br>
He leaned across the window-sill<br>
and purred, "Your arse is very fine!"<br>
for people do as people will.<br>
<br>
He died (Nathaniel) but, instead<br>
of grieving, she went out to dine<br>
(that's Clementine) on garlic bread <br>
and marinated porcupine.<br>
She choked (of course) upon a spine<br>
that lay concealed in fronds of dill.<br>
The waiter gave her shoes a shine<br>
for people do as people will.<br>
<br>
Rational souls, though you decline<br>
to heed my dismal codecil,<br>
pull up a chair, uncork the wine<br>
for people do as people will.<br>
