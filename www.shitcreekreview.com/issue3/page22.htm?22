Or not, it seems, for those wed more to quantum.</P>
</I>
<P>Many years ago, my eyes were opened to Plato's Realm of Ideas through a remarkable sleight-of-hand. A Political Theory professor asked us one day in class to name a physical characteristic common to all chairs. You could feel the class suddenly slackening --finally, an easy question! A chair has four legs, someone offered. There are three-legged chairs, the professor replied. A chair has a back-rest, said someone else. On the contrary, some chairs are backless, he responded. After a series of examples, it became clear there was no physical characteristic common to all chairs. The conclusion was inescapable. Chairs did not exist. After this a cave allegory seemed like so much piling on.</P>

<P>For those, like me, who departed imaginary numbers long ago, we are blessed indeed to have in our space-time corridor a wonderful explicator-to-the-masses,<I> </I>physicist Fred Alan Wolf. His various books, a sort of journeyman’s guide to quantum mechanics, should have the science fiction genre blushing in embarrassment over the latter’s staid unimaginativeness. Indeed for sheer speculative fervor, today’s quantum cosmology would give the late P. K. Dick a real (blade-)run for his money. Sorry.</P>

<P>In one of many fascinating passages in <I>Parallel Universes</I>, Wolf points out that the human mind, with its capacity to traverse past (via recollection) present (via the moment) and future (via speculation) is by itself a sort of time machine, an interpreter of ‘possibility waves’.  If the quantum potential of human consciousness can be fully exploited, time, long regarded a barrier, may be fully overcome --in time. Or, as the mystics have insisted for centuries, all will be revealed in the fullness of time. Wolf himself concedes the poets were there first. Eliot in his <I>Four Quartets</I> asserted that ‘all time is eternally present’. Emerson in <I>The Poet</I> suggested that poetry ‘existed before all time was.’ Indeed there is an out-of-time quality that clings to the best poetry. Time seems to slide off the back of excellent poetry because, yes that's right, the ravages of linear time are in great measure mitigated for the purest projections of consciousness; though never repealed.</P>

<P>Three cheers for the old guys. It seems Plato had anticipated quantum mechanics by over three millennia. Not bad for a guy without tape-reinforced glasses. For as we now 'know' (from this epoch forward, all intimations of knowledge must be bound in ironic quotations), matter at the subatomic level is nothing but a series of probabilities, that is to say, it isn't really there in a particle sense until we offer a <I>particular</I> rendition of it. In effect, we pluck a universe from an infinity of parallel universes traversing a wave. The physicists call this human intervention <I>wave collapse</I>.</P>

<P>Funny how, in a sort of retro-Copernican twist, quantum mechanics restores man to the center of his universe albeit as horribly reductive author. Jung maintained we were God's eye without which He could not see. He has Job gently guiding God through the Universe instructing Him in the ways of human morality. Traditionalists may bristle at the implied sacrilege. But who other than Job is the moral instructor in this most sublime of Old Testament books, gently chastising God in the responsibilities, perhaps unwitting excesses, of infinitude? And how different is his role really from that of the observer so essential to Neil Bohr's quantum world? Let the small minds quarrel over lexicons, syllabi and which professorial class fell upon what truth first. Unbeholden to tenure and its manifold evils, I simply say --speaking as a singularly unaffiliated man-- it's great to be king again!</P>

<P>In the same way, extant poetry is but a particle rescued from a void, an ember of stolen fire. To be sure books fill up with these shadow-forms, droplets tasked with evoking seas. But all that straddles the page is not poetry at all. To conceive a poem in its Platonic/ quantum sense, you'd have to wrestle a wave to the page. So we settle instead, and in the process of settling, a universe happens.</P>
<blockquote><P>&#9Wave to that nice particle.<br>
It's standing still for you.<br>
If you won't see it coming,<br>
it won't come into view.</P>
</blockquote>
<P>In A Survey of Modernist Poetry (1927), Laura Jackson Riding beats me to the punch by eighty years:</P>
<blockquote>
  <P>&#9... Method in poetry is therefore not anything that can be talked about in terms of physical form. The poem is not the paper, not the type, not the spoken syllables. It is as invisible and as inaudible as thought; and the only method that the real poet is interested in using is one that will present the poem without making it either visible or audible, without turning it into a substitute for a picture or for music. But when conservatism of method, through its abuse of slack-minded poets, has come to mean the supplanting of the poem by an exercise in poet-craft, then there is reasonable place for innovation, if the new method defeats the old method and brings up the important question: how should poetry be written? Once this question is asked, the new method has accomplished its end. Further than this it should not be allowed to go, for poems cannot be written from a formula. The principle value of a new method is that it can act as a strong deterrent against writing in a worn-out style. (p. 21)</P>
</blockquote>
<P>As Riding points out in her characteristic scolding tone (you can't convince me she didn't fulfill a dominatrix role in Graves' life), poetry is often misconstrued --particularly among 'slack-minded poets'— for poet-craft, that is, a thicket of words, syllables, sounds and techniques applied to typeset, applied to paper. From this, the urge towards the formulaic and its poor relations, convention and clich&eacute;, is a not-so-quantum leap into the seedy back-roads of stagnant verse. Earnest attempts at excellent poetry can founder on the artisan’s too-diligent workbench.</P>

<P>This is why defenders of the art often attack rote efforts with shocking ferocity. The bureaucratic spirit wants to be shown some rules before drawing a bath and taking a nap. Sleepwalkers pervade. However a poet must inhabit a Maoist-state of permanent revolution. Life for the poet is one big roiling question: how best to approach poetry <I>at this precise hour?</I> The quantum observer has the daunting task of expressing perpetual awe and perennial surprise. After all he is authoring a universe. The classical world of Newtonian pulleys and levers with their familiar squeaks and hums has receded forever. This recognition of a recently-eclipsed world helps fuel the post-Modernist ire towards formalist poetry which, at its worst, coddles a rule-based, diffident artist. Heisenberg is the father of the new aesthetic. That aesthetic is <I>uncertainty</I>.</P>

<blockquote><P>&#9The building blocks of paradox<br>
consist of dodgy charged-up quarks<br>
--or maybe not.</blockquote>
<P>At the sub-atomic level, nothing makes sense. This leaves us with paradox, the last sure place to rest our weary heads. Formalist poetry, paradoxically of course, provides a helpful and strangely liberating frame against which failure can be calibrated. Absent Kafka's bird-cage, all formulations of freedom are impossible to render. The archetype of <I>reaching and falling</I> litters the mythic record: Prometheus, Sisyphus, Orpheus. All were epic strivers who fell short, often with dire consequence: eternal torment, weighted chains, the stultifying curse of repetitive meaningless tasks. Nothing worth attaining is easy --even as failure is worse.</P>

<P>The best poems are spectacular failures, crash-and-burners in the highest aesthetic sense. The work of a poet, properly undertaken, is difficult and perilous. I’m reminded of a maxim that arose in the aftermath of the American Savings and Loan crisis: as soon as you find yourself having fun as a banker, you have departed the gray realm of banking. You are a ‘not-banker’ who nonetheless continues to show up for work. Richard Feynmann echoed this general sentiment in his description of quantum physics (and I’m paraphrasing): if you think you understand it, then you don't understand it. Poetry's no different. That which spills effortless from ones pen like manna from a loquacious god cannot possibly be the real thing. By ‘real', I mean of course in a Platonic sense --whatever that means.</P>

<P>In his series of on-line essay called <I>Logopoetry</I>, C.E. Chaffin defines the Gospel of John's conception of the Logos in <I>Logopoetry III</I> as:</P>

<blockquote>
  <P>&#9…the perfect expression of the inexpressible, the perfect form of the formless...an assumption all artists make each time they revise a poem or edit a score. Whatever urges them toward an ideal, toward their best-- whether the image of God within them or an evolutionary striving—bears testimony to the existence of the Logos. With each chip of the chisel, each stroke of the brush, artists acknowledge faith in an ideal never quite attained. This unrealized ideal is the inspiration behind their best efforts.</P>
</blockquote>

<P>Poetry is a convergence upon something 'never quite attained'. In this sense, it is process only, though oft-confused with final product. John's <I>logos</I> is nothing more really than a Christianized Platonism.</P>

<P>I do not wish to gloss the aesthetic appeal of one poet over another. By all means, let’s derive some enjoyment from a universe of failed attempts. Clearly some poets manage a greater fealty to the poetic ideal. Individual technique, skill, talent, stamina --all those aspects meted out to poets in unequal measure-- serve to render some poems 'more-perfect' than others; thus the enduring appeal of Yeats over, say, McGonagall. In short, there will always be good poets and bad poets. It's just that poetry, practiced even at its best, conforms to an asymptotic function; it seeks tirelessly to split the difference, converging on the X-axis infinitely. Consummate arrival is a myth, or in Chaffin’s words, a perpetually 'unrealized ideal.'</P>

<P>But I've banged the table long enough. And as any quantum guy will tell you, bang a table long enough (like an eternity or so), and your fist is bound to come clean through one time and slam you square in the solar plexus. Certitude is dead. Potentialities pose the only certainties. Nihilism must be resisted. That said, when consciousness is wed to imagination, the old clich&eacute; rings true: anything is possible. We must thank the scientists for delivering us finally to a place where the metaphysicians have been waiting all along. The ensuing convergence offers us, quite literally, a breathless infinity of possibilities.</P>

Nice thought to think a thinking mind<br>
might birth an alter-Zion.</P></blockquote>
