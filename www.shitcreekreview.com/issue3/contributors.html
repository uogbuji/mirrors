<P>Returning, inexplicably, to <I>The Shit Creek Review</I> for what is often delicately referred to as number two, <B><a name="ball" class="name">Norman Ball</a></B> has had nearly a hundred poems, articles and essays published over the last few years in venues bound by a singularly overriding vision: lax quality control. As further evidence that the apparent nadir in a writer's life is often but a low-lying plateau from which new depths are soon plunged, Norm has a number of poems coming out shortly in the <I>American Drivel Review</I>. How's that for some shit?</P>

<P>Australian <B><a name="byfield" class="name">Sam Byfield</a></B> is addicted to China, where he teaches English in a university, travels, studies Mandarin and writes. He has been published or has&nbsp;work forthcoming in print and online&nbsp;magazines <EM>Meridian, Diner</EM>, <EM>The Pedestal Magazine, Stirring, Eclectica, The Avatar Review, foam-e</EM> and&nbsp;others.

His poetry has appeared in <I>Measure, The Formalist, Dark Horse, Iambs &amp; Trochees, Texas Poetry Journal, The Atlanta Review</I>, and many other journals and anthologies.</P>

<B><P><a name="copeland" class="name">K.R. Copeland</a></B> is a hopelessly romantic sociopath who openly admits to being a poet, but only in the privacy of her fully-padded living quarters. She's been published a bunch, has a chapbook available through Dancing Girl Press, and acts as the Art Director at <A HREF="http://www.unlikelystories.org/"><I>Unlikely 2.0</I>.</A></P>

<B><P><a name="epstein" class="name">Richard Epstein’s</a></B> poems have been published in obscure literary journals, little magazines, and academic quarterlies and have been doing so for a long time now.&nbsp; If you haven't noticed, that's your fault, not his.&nbsp; Now, it seems, they'll appear in excremental zines, too, which, considering his academic background in 18th-century British literature, seems entirely appropriate.&nbsp; He lives in Denver.&nbsp; His own, somewhat more sanitized blog, can be read at <A HREF="http://rhepoems.blogspot.com/">http://rhepoems.blogspot.com/</A>.</P>

He writes in English and modern Scots, mostly in form, and with no particular life theme, preferring to ring the changes in subject matter and style. If he ever 'finds his voice' it'll be time to stop. He has heard it said that in order to publish, one must submit for publication. This sounds too much like hard work.</P>
