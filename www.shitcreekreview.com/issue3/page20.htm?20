So how did Lazarus’ wife feel<br>
When her husband came back<br>
From his very dramatic second act?<br>
<br>
Would he seamlessly pick up the old reflexes<br>
The same routine – dinner with his mother<br>
Every Friday night, Saturday night sex,<br>
Or would he have visions of something other?<br>
<br>
Would he just drop his winding sheet<br>
And suddenly want to buy a Porsche?<br>
Would he demand divorce? Become a<br>
Hippy, a zealot? Or do nothing at all – a life replete<br>
<br>
Not needing a different wife or<br>
A different life.<br>
<br>
But still,<br>
When you have been resurrected,<br>
Either to amuse Jesus or serve some<br>
Opaque higher purpose, <br>
When your life has been turned into parable,<br>
<br>
People will scream and stare. They faint.<br>
Your debtors despair and your creditors stop<br>
Gnashing their teeth. But mostly they want <br>
You to tell them what it’s like to die.<br>
<br>
But Lazarus, all he wants to talk about is<br>
Being alive. He grows vague about the dying.<br>
He disappoints with no tale of angels or<br>
Gorgons although sometimes into her pillow<br>
<br>
He will mention the night train to Edinburgh,<br>
All darkness and motion with a sudden flash<br>
When you pause at a level crossing. There was<br>
A clang and a lurch forward and he looked out <br>
<br>
Through a rain splashed window. <br>
It was that mundane. It was that sublime.<br>
Although for him, this time<br>
They managed to clear the leaves off the line.<br>
<br>
He reached the station but<br>
It was not a terminus. All change.<br>
