  Mark believed that he wanted to be an airline pilot, and he completed a private 
  flying licence at 17. Before long, however, he realized that flying was merely 
  a metaphor of his desire to rise above the pettiness of daily life, in order 
  to see the big picture. Eventually this desire for vertical transcendence led 
  to a Ph.D in English literature, and he taught for a while at Monash University, 
  in Melbourne. Mark is now entirely grounded, and living and writing on the NSW 
  coast, south of Sydney.</p>
