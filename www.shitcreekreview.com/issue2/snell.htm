    <td class="poem">  The cover of Jennifer Gresham&#8217;s<em> Diary of a Cell</em> shows a 
        cell, one of the &#8220;beautiful, dividing sacks / of water and code,&#8221; 
        dividing. This sets up an expectation for readers &#151; we want to glimpse 
        the art in the science, to experience for ourselves the elegance of transformation. 
        As A. R. Ammons says in the anthology <em>Verse &amp; Universe: Poems 
        about Science and Mathematics</em>, &#8220;it is wonderful how things 
        work: I will tell you about it because it is interesting.&#8221; 
		
		<P>
		
		  A scientific framework can reveal beauty visible under a microscope, and 
        the language of science is rich with metaphoric potential. The diary in 
        the title poem is <BR><BR></td>

		<em>&#8220;&#8230; always written in code; <BR>
		a whole library <BR>
        of nothing more <BR>
		 than four letters strung together,<BR>
		  a tongue-twister <BR>
        even if <BR> you know the language.&#8221;<br></em>
        <br>
        &#8220;It&#8217;s an injustice that only neuro-doctors get to say these 
        words&#8221; says Thomas Lux, in <em>Verse and Universe</em>. Gresham, 
        a biochemist, knows what she knows and we trust the voice. &#8220;&#8230;Jennifer 
        Gresham lays a sharply focused lens of language on the surface of experience, 
        to learn, as she says in &#8220;Anatomy,&#8221; &#8220;the secrets of 
        the deep,&#8221; Michael Collier notes. The solemnity of the situation&#8212;students&#8217; 
        first experience with a cadaver &#151; does not overwhelm the poem&#8217;s 
        music or its images.<BR><BR>
		<em>
		 &#8220;We did not expect a young woman<BR>
		 &#8230; her 
        nose a mountain on the plain <BR>
		of her face, her neck and arms<BR>
		 thin as    dried reeds&#8221; <BR><BR></em>
		 
		 Gresham begins. <BR><BR><em>
		 &#8220;Awestruck, the Latin rose to 
        our lips <BR>
		 like a sigh: the graceful length <BR> 
		 of her gracilis, her shapely 
        gluteus medius, <BR>
		 the sweep of the orbicularis oris <BR>
		  beneath her stiff,         unsmiling lips.&#8221; </em><BR><BR>
		  
		  
		  The technical words don&#8217;t exclude us; in 
        fact, they protect against emotional excess.<br>
        <br>
        Gresham&#8217;s exploratory, precise point-of-view powers not only the 
        science poems but the philosophical ones as well. Many of the lyrical 
        narratives grapple with big questions, and we gain entry into the poems 
        from many angles: &#8220;Model of an Atom&#8221; compares Schrodinger&#8217;s 
        creative work to obsessive love; in &#8220;To End All Wars,&#8221; we 
        meet Oppenheimer, <BR><BR>
		
		<em>&#8220;&#8230;eyes full of ash, the rising <BR>
		 sun eclipsed. 
        How hollow <BR>
		are the refrains of discovery <BR>
		 when one has become death, <BR>
         destroyer of worlds.&#8221; <BR><BR></em>
		 
		 With her command of poetic device, imagery 
        and sound in particular, Gresham goes beyond the surface of the poems, 
        adding layers of meaning. The following piece recalls Einstein&#8217;s 
        dream, and wears its erudition lightly. It opens up new insights with 
        charm and accessibility; it wants to be read aloud.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Explaining Relativity to the Cat</u><br><br>
        Imagine, if you will, three mice.<br>
        Contrary to what you have<br>
        heard, they are not blind<br>
        but are in a spaceship<br>
        traveling near the speed of light.<br>
        This makes them unavailable<br>
        for your supper, yes. </P>
      <p>So these mice, traveling near<br>
        the speed of light, appear<br>
        quite fat, though there is<br>
        no cheese aboard. This is<br>
        simply a distortion of mass,<br>
        because the mass of a mouse<br>
        is nothing more than a bundle<br>
        of light, and vice versa. I see<br>
        how this might imply mice<br>
        are in the light fixtures,<br>
        undoubtedly a problem, so</p>
      <p>let me try again.<br>
        If two people attempted<br>
        to feed you simultaneously,<br>
        no doubt a good situation,<br>
        but you were on a train<br>
        traveling near the speed<br>
        of light, the food would<br>
        appear unappetizing, falling<br>
        to the plate in slow motion,<br>
        an extended glob of protein<br>
        that never smelled good,<br>
        if you ask me, train or no.<br>
        The affinity of the food<br>
        for the plate, what we call<br>
        gravity, is really just<br>
        a stretch in the fabric<br>
        of a space-time continuum,<br>
        what happens when you<br>
        have sat in a seat too long,<br>
        perhaps on this very train.</p>
      <p>Oh kitty, I know how you hate<br>
        to travel and the journey must<br>
        have made you tired. Come now,<br>
        lick your coat one more time<br>
        and let us make haste<br>
        from this strange city<br>
        of light and fantastic dream.</p>
      <p><br>
        In several of the poems, Gresham&#8217;s sense of humor is much in evidence. 
        Consider the dieter in &#8220;Empty Calories,&#8221; a nephew&#8217;s 
        &#8220;Booger,&#8221; the joyous &#8220;A Scientist&#8217;s Acrostic&#8221; 
	
		
        (&#8220;&#8230;Scientists are like beetles
		<BR> Crawling over the earth, 
        antennae twitching...&#8221;). &#8220;Love in Nerdville&#8221; tells the 
        story of one couple with this characterization &#151; &#8220;She was the lemon, 
        he the copper wire.&#8221; Gresham often couples exuberance with restraint 
        in her examination of how it feels to be alive in a way that brings to 
        mind Stephen Dunn. <br>
        <br>
        I&#8217;ll leave you with the poem that closes the collection. It&#8217;s 
        one of my favorites. I like it for its tenderness and the way it shows 
        how the waking mind can influence realities that give rise to our nightmares. 
        As Charles Harper Webb says in his introduction, <em>Diary of a Cell</em> 
        is poetic, &#8220;not in a namby-pamby, sensitive-soul-in-an-insenstive-world 
        way; in the strong and competent sense of poietes:maker.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
       <u> Another Imagined Infidelity</u></p>
      <p>Sometimes I wake up<br>
        at three in the morning,<br>
        wounded: a temptress running<br>
        her fingers down your arm<br>
        at a dinner party, you in bed<br>
        with my best friend from childhood.<br>
        Every now and then, you hit<br>
        a new low. This time, <br>
        an exotic woman was lost <br>
        and called our number by mistake.<br>
        You guided her through<br>
        unfamiliar territory out of kindness,<br>
        your voice terribly calm.</p>
      <p>We have been married too long<br>
        for this. When I rouse you <br>
        from sleep to detail your crimes, <br>
        you groggily humor me. Why <br>
        does this one count against me? <br>
        Because I, too, was lost once, <br>
        and you are still the landmark I cling to.</p>
