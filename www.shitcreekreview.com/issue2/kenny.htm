<P>





 

 




i<br>
You will get used to it, they said.<br>
Open your eyes. These things are real. Accept<br>
what you can't change. The past is dead.<br>
You have more work to do. All your inept<br>
battles with nightmares wasted time.<br>
Seasons and dancing happened while you slept.<br>
Missing one moment is a crime.<br>
Nothing you ever said or did has kept<br>
oblivion in its place.<br>
Oceans and fires and men have always swept<br>
over the sacred. You must face<br>
that all you can have is <em>now</em>. And then I wept.<br>
<P>
ii<br>
Rain in the sky is never bad<br>
unless, of course there is a flood.<br>
Watermarked walls signal places where<br>
a farming family met despair.<br>
Featureless dust shimmers to the smudge<br>
of mirage horizon where cattle trudge<br>
behind a tractor for scanty feed,<br>
never sufficient for their need.<br>
Lambs spread like garments on the clay<br>
as raptors tug their flesh away.<br>
The child who watches cannot know<br>
the danger known to man and crow.<br>
<P>
iii<br>
City dwellers complain of prices<br>
and dress up their cooking with Asian spices.<br>
Fish is expensive and, they have read,<br>
polluted as well, <em>so the paper's said</em>.<br>
Omega 3 versus heavy metals.<br>
<em>They'll have to wait till the weather settles</em>.<br>
Bananas gone in a hurricane, rain<br>
came hammering down then vanished again.<br>
Grain crops germinate, then die<br>
beneath the tourist-blue smiling sky.<br>
I buy organic Italian pasta<br>
to circumvent a worse disaster.<br>
Vitamin pills are bought in stealth:<br>
<em>You're all right as long as you've got your health</em>.<br>
<P>
iv<br>
The voice on the radio gives no quarter:<br>
<em>Australia is running out of water.<br>
Recycled effluent soon will be<br>
the answer for your cup of tea.<br></em>
"I know I'm silly," said Aunty Jean,<br>
"but I hate to think where the water's been."<br>
The voice on the radio condescends.<br>
<em>It's just a drink that you share with friends</em>.<br>
Water is measured by can and bucket<br>
and only the dedicated have stuck it.<br>
Native plants withstand the dry<br>
and spare us glares from the passers by.<br>
Water spies are like Stasi, snooping<br>
to see whose garden is never drooping.<br>
<em>That's drinking water you're wasting on roses.</em><br>
(There's more to the neighbours than one supposes.)<br>
Lawns are brown in the best of houses<br>
and mowers set free from nagging spouses.<br>
I live beside the brooding sea.<br>
It may rise up to visit me.<br>
A drought that drowns is a paradox<br>
that casts our bread upon the rocks.<br>
<P>
v<br>
A flickering dark-skinned figure is almost seen<br>
beyond the trees on my lawn.<br>
It's there for a moment then gone.<br>
Illusion in the dawn<br>
or something that might have been?<br>
<P>
vi<br>
I drove past a Murri woman who bore<br>
her heavy shopping home from the store.<br>
I wanted to offer to drive her home<br>
but something about her made me become<br>
tongue-tied and shy. I drove on past<br>
and around the corner a bit too fast.<br>
Fool, fool, such a simple human gift<br>
as to offer another shopper a lift.<br>
Her eyes were proud and her back was straight.<br>
There was something haughty about her gait.<br>
I feared she would answer, "It isn't far<br>
to the spot nearby where I parked my car."<br>
<P>
vii<br>
Alone with Aboriginal poles in the gallery's bowels,<br>
I'm gripped by fear. They accuse me. I came<br>
to ravage their land. I am to blame.<br>
I am to blame. I chose to come.<br>
Their weeping echoes from gallery walls.<br>
Does new love ever displace the old?<br>
Young wives move in when the bed gets cold.<br>
The grass told King Midas's secrets, and here<br>
in this old, new land trees whispered fear.<br>
And now the trees scream, <em>fire, fire fire!</em><br>
<em>You must accept the funeral pyre.</em><br>
The sky is black with the souls of birds<br>
and trails of ink from unheeded words.<br>
<P>
viii<br>
Don't get used to it, they said.<br>
Open your eyes. These things are real. Accept<br>
you have to change. Remember the dead.<br>
They now depend on you. All your inept<br>
justifications deepen your crime.<br>
You have been faking rage while justice slept.<br>
We have been waiting all the time.<br>
None of your promises ever have been kept.<br>
This is our only space.<br>
Oceans and fires and wind have always swept<br>
thieves from our sacred place.<br>
You must return it now. <em>Give us respect.</em><br>
<br>
 



<P>
