<p><span class="name"><strong>Robert Cook</strong></span> is an intensely private man, refusing to read newspapers or even eat oysters on Sundays. He considers photography more an obsession than an art. You can study his condition at <a href="http://briefasphotos.com">http://briefasphotos.com</a>
</p>
  
  <p><span class="name"><strong>Betsyann Duval</strong></span>, a Boston-based artist, has received numerous awards 
  for her work in National exhibitions, including a First Prize in Painting awarded by Lisa Dennison, Chief Curator of the 
  Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, NYC.  Using a variety of media from painting to performance, she engages her audience by posing questions 
  that challenge social, cultural, and biological stereotypes. Her Bodyscape Series explores the beauty of the human form  
  and what it means to be human in the face of blatant, commercial sexual stereotyping.

 educated in New York City.  She  has worked as an art director, designer and illustrator; and now spends her time

<p><span class="name"><strong>Hanka Jaskowska</strong></span> is a 21 year old living in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. 
She is currently studying Art and Design, taking the first steps in fulfilling
an ambition of a career in prop-making and sculptural costume for theatre/screen.
One of her primary hobbies is photography, within which she can often
be found being looked at strangely for finding interest in the less interesting things.
</p>
<p><span class="name"><strong>Patricia Wallace Jones</strong></span> is a retired disability advocate 
  with an art degree who knows what it's like to be up Shit Creek. She loves having 
  the time now (not to mention a paddle) to be what she wanted to be when she 
  grew up. More of her work can be seen at <a href="http://imagineii.typepad.com/imagineii/" class="poemlink">http://imagineii.typepad.com/imagineii/</a></p>

 and he is currently working on an exhibit for the Amsterdam Whitney Gallery. </P>

<p><span class="name"><strong>Paul Stevens</strong></span> spends a lot of time staring into space and occasionally takes photographs of it.</a></p>

<p><span class="name"><strong>Donald Zirilli</strong></span>, Donald Zirilli lets see be finale of seem, or to put
it more succinctly, "let's see."
