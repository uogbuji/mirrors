	<h2>Matriarch of Springwater Flats </h2>


<P>



	


	





My wild-eyed uncle drank so much <br>
he forgot the dimensions of his house. <br>
Walked off the green-painted porch <br>
and broke his one good leg. <br>
<P>
He punched the neighbor's dog <br>
who thought his writhing was play. <br>
The poor thing howled at the end of its chain, <br>
groomed itself calm beneath the holly scrub. <br>
When the ambulance bounced up on the curb <br>
he was screaming for another drink. <br>
His sweat-soaked body had a street light sheen. <br>
<P>
I dreamed for weeks of his strapped-down arms, <br>
the sharp holly leaves stuck to his skin like ticks. <br>
Sheriff's deputies came late to the party,  gathered in <br>
the shadows of the yard <br>
looking for dope and counting the open cans of beer. <br>
Their sniggering dried up in the heat<br>
of my Grandmother's moonlight stare. <br>
<P>
No one dared offer her a ride to the ER. <br>
No one said, <em>Momma, you should really come in</em>.<br> 
Laughter slipped through the kitchen window <br>
as one young deputy clacked toward his car, <br>
a crushed beer can making a high heel of his boot. <br>
He never took his hand from the butt of his gun. <br>
She never looked him directly in the eye. <br>
She never looked away.<br>


<P>
