<p>Born of Nordic and Irish stock in chilly Minnesota, I conceived a passion for the folk music of the Irish, the Scots, and their descendants in Canada and Appalachia. Later, when my voice crashed, I turned to the poetry of Frost and Yeats, but the Scottish Border ballads and Robert Burns have always remained dear to me. Lallans seemed a native tongue to me.</p>

<p>At Yale I learned more about the roots of our language. Not all the 30,000 lines I memorized were Modern English. Some were Greek (the opening of <i>The Iliad</i>), and others were Old or Middle English (favorite passages from <i>Beowulf</i>, Chaucer, and various medieval lyrics). Elsewhere I have written how I was fascinated as a student to hear John Pope reciting the <i>Wulf</i>. I never forgot the cadence of its accentual tetrameter, so apt to martial or elegiac themes.</p>

<p>A generation later, challenged by a student of my own, I decided to try my hand on <i>Beowulf</i> passages I had memorized in college. As my long-time editor, Alan was soon poring over Klaeber’s scholarly edition of the text. An ardent fan of Tolkien, he was startled to realize time and again that some term from <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> was actually an Anglo-Saxon word: <i>orthanc</i> really did mean 'skill'; and <i>eored</i>, 'a troop of cavalry'. The wily professor had been teaching while he entertained.</p>

<p>At West Chester, Mike Peich decided to hold a session on poetic translation for the 1999 conference. Alan and I were partway through our <i>Beowulf</i> by then. We had prepared a chapbook of the poem’s final third, which we completed first because it contained the elegiac passages that most appealed to me. ‘Beowulf and the Dragon’ had already circulated among our friends, receiving the <i>imprimatur</i> of eminent translators like Richard Wilbur and Dick Davis, who encouraged us to complete the project posthaste. I had neither the time nor the inclination, but Alan worked full-time on the <i>Wulf</i> for the rest of that year. When the millennium ended in frozen Fargo, he had closed the gap between <i>Hwaet!</i> and Beowulf’s accession to kingship. </p>

<p>Here is a vivid passage that comes early in the 3182-line poem. It describes the coming of evil to the high hall of Heorot, the grandest dwelling ever erected in the land of the Danes. It also gives some notion of life in such a hall, where the principal entertainment, aside from the drinking of mead, was recitation of poetry by a <i>scop</i>. In the Dark Ages, poetry was strictly an oral tradition in the north of Europe. Few people were literate, and the songs of the <i>scops</i> had not yet been written out. Poets committed whole epics to memory and sang for a living.</p>

<blockquote>Each day, one evil   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   dweller in darkness<br />
spitefully suffered   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   the din from that hall<br />
where Hrothgar’s men  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    made merry with mead.<br />
Harp-strings would sound,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    and the song of the scop<br />
would recount the tales   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   told of time past:<br />
whence mankind had come,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    and how the Almighty <br />
had fashioned flat land,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   fair to behold,<br />
surrounded with water.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The worker of wonders<br />
lifted and lit    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   the sun and moon<br />
for Earth’s dwellers;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   He filled the forests<br />
with branches and blooms;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   He breathed life<br />
into all kinds of creatures.<br />
~&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the king’s thanes<br />
gathered in gladness;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  then crime came calling,<br />
a horror from hell,    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  hideous Grendel,<br />
wrathful rover   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   of borders and moors,<br />
holder of hollows,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   haunter of fens.<br />
He had lived long   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   in the homeland of horrors,<br>
born to the band   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   whom God had banished<br />
as kindred of Cain,  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    thereby requiting<br />
the slayer of Abel.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Many such sprang<br />
from the first murderer:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   monsters and misfits,<br />
elves and ill-spirits,   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   also those giants<br />
whose wars with the Lord  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    earned them exile.<br />

<p>As the translation panel convened at West Chester, Alan and I sat between Robert Mezey and tall, gaunt John Ridland, who had translated Janos Vitek’s 'John the Valiant' from Hungarian. The classroom had filled, and latecomers were standing near the door while more chairs were brought. There had been some buzz around the corridors, and it had attracted a gratifying crowd. Dick Davis chaired the panel and spoke what is probably an old chestnut that I had never heard. 'Translations are like lovers. There are those that are true and unbeautiful, and there are those that are beautiful but untrue.' </p>

<p>Bob gave a scholarly but passionate presentation, comparing his versions of Borges with the originals and with the received translations in the Viking Penguin. Throughout the room there were sighs of pleasure at the former, while smirks, rolled eyes, and shaken heads greeted the latter. </p>

<p>Alan then talked about the guidelines we had created and followed for our version of <i>Beowulf</i>. To close the session, I recited the final 44 lines, the dirge, in Anglo-Saxon and in our recreation of the alliterative tetrameter. When I concluded, Bob blurted 'God that sounds magnificent!' </P>

<p>Professor Mezey left West Chester almost immediately after the panel. I only chatted with him briefly while snatching a smoke outside Sykes Hall, but another literary correspondence began soon afterward. I was spending more and more of my office time engaged with literary mail, and my secretary had become a custodian for incoming and outgoing manuscripts.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 2000, Bob invited me to Claremont, where I lectured and read. As I was walking into the English Department, a UPS guy was hauling in a box, <i>The Collected Poems of Robert Mezey</i>, just published by Arkansas. What a daunting arrival! I curled up with the book that evening and first read what I believe to be one of the greatest poems of the last century: <blockquote>

<b>Tea Dance at the Nautilus Hotel (1925)</b> 


<p>The gleam of eyes under the striped umbrellas&#8212;<br />
We see them still, after so many years,<br />
(Or think we do)&#8212;the young men and their dears,<br />
Bandying forward glances as through masks<br />
In the curled bluish haze of panatellas,<br />
And taking nips from little silver flasks. <br /><br />

They sit at tables as the sun is going,<br />
Bent over cigarettes and lukewarm tea,<br />
Talking small talk, gossip and gallantry,<br />
Some of them single, some husbands and wives,<br />
Laughing and telling stories, all unknowing<br />
They sit here in the heyday of their lives. <br /><br />

And some then dance off in the late sunlight,<br />
Lips brushing cheeks, hands growing warm in hands,<br />
Feet gliding at the lightest of commands,<br />
All summer on their caught or sighing breath<br />
As they whirl on toward the oncoming night,<br />
and nothing further from their thoughts than death. <br /><br />

But they danced here sixty-five years ago!&#8212;<br />
Almost all of them must be underground.<br />
Who could be left to smile at the sound<br />
Of the oldfangled dance tunes and each pair<br />
Of youthful lovers swaying to and fro?<br />
Only a dreamer, who was never there. <br /><br /><br />

<i>by Robert Mezey</i></p></blockquote>


<p>I find this poem as poignant as the evocation of a vanished tribe in a passage that introduces the final third of <i>Beowulf</i>.  ‘The Lay of the Last Survivor,’ scholars call it. The poet envisions the guardian of a great treasure hiding the hoard in a deep-delved hall where no cup would ever pass, no harp ever ring. The elegiac voice has always spoken to me, even in my youth. So I worshipped ‘Sailing to Byzantium,’ which also dwelt on artifacts and their evocation of bygone time.</p>

<p>Eliot said of Yeats “He is the greatest of the modern poets in English, and so far as I am able to judge, in any language.” As a student, I shared that sentiment. As a novice poet, I wrote Yeats-derived verse. Like such predecessors as Roethke or Schwartz, I conversed too much with an Irish ghost. At least I had the excuse of shared ethnicity. </p>

<p>Eliot knew a lot of languages, and I am a monoglot, but I have come to doubt his extravagant claim. As a young man, I already sensed in translation the greatness of poets like Po Chu’i or Catullus. As I grew older, Yeats seemed more and more preposterous. His ear was surely remarkable, and his dedication to Ireland undeniable, but his aristocratic pretenses no longer impressed me.</p>

<p>Of course Eliot also wrote a lamentable essay denigrating Thomas Hardy and praising Lord Tennyson to the skies. I yield to no one in my fondness for Tennyson, but the moderns I most revere are Hardy, Frost, and Borges. These are poets with powerful, distinctive voices. It takes humility to subordinate one’s own voice to a great original.  I challenge anyone to distinguish between the Mezey and Barnes versions of Borges, or to distinguish between the Murphy and Sullivan passages in <i>Beowulf</i>.  It’s a stark contrast to a Lowell or Bly, both of whom made every poet they translated sound like Lowell or Bly!  Since I lack Spanish, my clearest window into Borges is Bob Mezey. I will always be grateful to him.<blockquote>
<br />
<b>Casa Abandonada</b><br />
<i>for Robert Mezey</i><br /><br />

Though he labors in the shadows,<br />
the library of his mind<br />
is a corridor of windows<br />
whose occupant is blind. <br /><br />

The manse is Argentina<br />
but a mirror gives on Spain<br />
as a gaucho’s ocarina<br />
moans through a broken pane. <br /><br />

Cobwebs trail from ceilings<br />
over lovers and their bowers.<br />
Mice run on the railings;<br />
a cracked clock-face glowers. <br /><br />

Fingering newel or plinth,<br />
the blind man cannot see<br />
his way through this labyrinth.<br />
Neither, my friend, can we. <br /></blockquote></p>
