<p>The poet who is most closely associated in the popular imagination with present-day Australia is Les Murray. He is probably the only living poet whose name would be known by the man on the street. A great many Australians would recognise his face if he walked past them. He is like Australia itself in that he makes few concessions to the formalities of life.</p>

<p>He has written and spoken of his mild Asperger’s syndrome and periods of serious depression.  He eccentrically combines the deceptive simplicity of the idiot savant with the sophistication of the academic scholar and the introspection of a saint. Add to these a farmer, a son, a parent and a husband and you have at least understood a fraction of the complexity that adds up to Les Murray the poet.</p>

<p>Non-Australians are sometimes alienated by poems of Murray’s which seem to them to use a private language.  And so they do but it is a private language to which many Australians feel they have the key. His words are reduced to a strong minimum. He cuts to the chase. He digs into his own mind to find his poetic language.  He conducts very little conversation with what Harold Bloom calls the “literary canon”.  He is an outsider like William Blake.  His words seem to splatter like the paint of Jackson Pollock and yet each word is deliberately chosen.</p>

<p>Here are the first two stanzas of his poem about oysters.</p>


<blockquote>Baby oyster, little grip,<br />
settling into your pinch of shape<br />
on a flooded timber rack:<br /><br />

little living gravel<br />
I’m the human you need,<br />
one who won’t eat you…<br />
<br />

(‘To Me You’ll Always be Spat‘)</blockquote>

<p>His poem ‘Lyrebird’ is unintelligible to all but those who have experienced the extraordinary display and mimicry of the lyrebird. Australians respond easily to this coded language.</p>

<p>In this poem he uses rhyming couplets but his meter is loose:<blockquote>

Liar made of leaf-litter, quivering ribby in shim,<br />
hen-sized under froufrou, chinks in a quiff display him<br />
or her, dancing in mating time, or out. And in any order.<br />
Tailed mimic aeon-sent to intrigue the next recorder.<br />
I mew catbird, I saw crosscut, I howl she-dingo, I kink<br />
forest hush distinct with bellbirds, warble magpie garble, link ...</blockquote>


<p>When Les’s friend, the Australian writer Bob Ellis, was planning to make a television program with Murray, his left-wing friends objected to Bob being associated with the poetry editor of the right-wing journal, <em>Quadrant</em>.  Bob Ellis said that he knew Murray was a fascist but he was a nice fascist.</p>

<p>Here is an epigram by Les Murray:

<blockquote><b>Politics and Art</b><br />

Brutal policy,<br />
like inferior art, knows<br />
whose fault it all is.<br /></blockquote>


<p>Les Murray annoys many environmentalists because of his sympathy with people whose livelihood is earned in the forestry industry and farming. He is impatient with environmentalists who fail to sympathise with the workers whose jobs they threaten. He romanticises and some might say, sentimentalises, the rural working class whose manners and tastes are out of step with what Les Murray might see as chardonnay socialists. </p>

<p>In ‘Poetry and Religion’ he writes:<blockquote>

Religions are poems. They concert<br />
our daylight and dreaming mind, our<br />
emotions, instinct, breath and native gesture...<br /></blockquote>

<p>In a moving poem about his father, ‘The Last Hello’ the last stanza is blunt:<blockquote>

Snobs mind us off religion<br />
nowadays, if they can.<br />
Fuck thém. I wish you God.<br />
</blockquote>

<p>Murray often “becomes” the thing he writes about. He is beyond mystery because he becomes the mystery:<blockquote>


<p>Crumpled in a coign I was  milk-tufted with my suckling<br />
till he prickled.<br />
He entered the earth pouch then<br />
and learned ant-ribbon,<br />
the gloss we put like lightning on the brimming ones.<br />
Life is fat is sleep.  I feast life on, and sleep it,<br />
deep loveself in calm...<br />
<br />

(‘Echidna’)</p></blockquote>

Yet the same poet writes descriptively of the emu:<blockquote>


<p>Weathered blond as a grass tree, a huge Beatles haircut<br />
raises an alert periscope and stares out<br />
over scrub. Her large olivine eggs click<br />
oilily together; her lips of noble plastic<br />
clamped in their expression, her head-fluff a stripe<br />
worn mohawk style, she bubbles her pale-blue windpipe...<br />
<br />

(‘Second Essay on Interest: the Emu’)</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first poem the poet is his poem. In the second poem he tells his poem.</p>

<p>I have often thought that Les Murray’s poems can be divided between “being” and “telling”. Here is another one of Murray’s “being” poems:<blockquote>


<p>My big friend, I bow help;<br />
I bow Get up, big friend:<br />
let me land-swim again beside your clicky feet,<br />
don’t sleep flat with dried wet in your holes.<br /><br />

(‘Goose to Donkey’)</p></blockquote>
 
<p>And yet in essence this poem is not too far from Thomas Hardy’s triolet:</p>

<p>In contrast the American Walt Whitman used nature to reflect upon life itself and humanity. He is an observer who is aware of his own mystery:</p><blockquote>

<p>A noiseless patient spider,<br /> 
I mark'd where on a little promontory it stood isolated,<br />  
Mark'd how to explore the vacant, vast surrounding, <br /> 
It launched forth filament, filament, filament, out of itself. <br /> 
Ever unreeling them, ever tirelessly speeding them. <br /> <br /> 

And you O my soul where you stand, <br /> 
Surrounded, detatched, in measureless oceans of space, <br /> 
Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them. <br /> 
Till the bridge you will need be form'd, till the ductile anchor hold, <br /> 
Till the gossamer thread you fling catch somewhere, O my soul.<br /> <br /> 

(Walt Whitman,‘A Noiseless Patient Spider’)</p></blockquote>


 
<p>Les Murray is strongly metaphysical.  His best-loved poem is ‘An Absolutely Ordinary Rainbow’, in which Sydney’s city life is transfigured by the presence of a weeping man.The two last stanzas give some idea of the poem’s power:</p><blockquote>

..and many weep for sheer acceptance, and more<br /> 
refuse to weep for fear of all acceptance,<br /> 
but the weeping man, like the earth, requires nothing,<br /> 
the man who weeps ignores us, and cries out<br /> 
of his writhen face and ordinary body<br /> <br /> 

not words, but grief, not messages, but sorrow,<br /> 
hard as the earth, sheer, present as the sea&#8212;<br />
and when he stops, he simply walks between us<br />
mopping his face with the dignity of one<br />
man who has wept, and now has finished weeping.<br /><br />

Evading believers, he hurries off down Pitt Street.<br /></blockquote></p>

<p>Les Murray’s inner life becomes more explicable when we know something of his early family experiences.  In this Australian Broadcasting Corporation interview conducted by Peter Thompson on 27 March  2005, Les Murray talks about the shyness of rural poverty. I’ll let Les tell his own story.  He does it much better than I can.</p>
