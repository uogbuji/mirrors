<p>Anyone casting a suitably dyspeptic eye over the contemporary poetry wars will be struck by the indisputable fact that the tradition of experimental and avant-gardist writing from the 1960s and 1970s onwards (key figures being so diverse as J. H. Prynne, Tom Raworth and Douglas Oliver representing Cambridge, London and 'International' respectively) has proven much more difficult to domesticate and make popular than any other previous avant-garde. Every undergraduate course in French literature, for example, duly takes note of Apollinaire and the Surrealists, and the standard-bearers of English modernism from Ezra Pound  to Zukovsky to the poetry of Lawrence Durrell (though some take him for a traditional writer, he is, compared to such other popular figures of the 'forties as Heath-Stubbs or Dylan Thomas, a firm believer in syntactic dislocation and the muse of a non-logical poetry, as his theoretical work, <em>A Key to Modern British Poetry</em> demonstrates) were within a couple of decades read with affection and enthusiasm by a wide public. How many people will ever read much of the work of Ulli Freer with understanding and pleasure?  Partly, the difference can be attributed to publishers, and the decline of the independent bookshop. Such an economic analysis will only partly do, I think. The close connection between certain theories of discourse and the practice of poetry must also take its fair share of the blame.</p>

<P>I have often thought that underlying many of the distinctions between rival schools of poetry has been the extent to which form (which demands to be recognized as such, rather than something that any coherent content has) and ego are to be aligned. Obviously there are different ways of politicizing this question, and it is one of the failures of the conservative position that it not been able to coherently articulate its intellectual presuppositions, with the normal conservative response that ‘We don't need a theory, for what we are doing is more organic and more dependent on normal human relations’ being woefully inadequate.  For some, left-wing ideas of the decentred self under the lights of the 1960s avant-garde (and various forms of post-structuralist theory) seem appropriate (whether or not these were in fact drawn from text or seemingly 'collective' practice of other art forms). An alternative soi-disant radical nexus of ideas would be drawn from the various mutations of feminism from the nineteen seventies onward. The left, however, does not have a monopoly on ideas of the requirement to batten down a childish and self-seeking ego, with the resulting consumerism and domination. A right-wing intellectual model for dealing with the pains and pleasures of the ego, with all of its necessary growing up and disciplining, would entail a sort of sympathetic engagement with institutions (a friend came up recently with the formulation that a Tory is someone who believes institutions are wiser than individuals). </P>

<p>One ends up with the hardly striking observation that taking different modes of social and ethical engagement as foundational will naturally result in other forms of or relations to the self with a knock-on effect on aesthetics and the forms and concerns and tone of the poetry one writes. One thinks of how so many great poets of friendship (from Horace to Donne to Auden to John Fuller) have also been poets of ego. One a more personal note, let me say that whenever I write of human relations in my own poetry, I tend simply to want to record accurately the stable socialized commitments that ebb and flow in and out of the networks of friendship and love and sex. This is, fairly obviously, a recognizably gay male aesthetic that privileges a combination of ego, archness and group identity and ability to ventriloquize others, yet to do so respectfully and with honesty.  As my friend Simon said of our rather more ‘angry’ friend Mike, ‘You don't have to fight it, you know? Society's not the enemy. Nasty people are the enemy.’ </p>

<p>For some this approach places the muse of poetry too readily at the service of rhetorical functions (to console, to teach, to persuade into bed) that they will find are the route to the ‘Astleyization’ (those <em>Staying Alive</em> anthologies) of poetry or its simplistic totalitarian aims. It is important not to be explicit. The range of humane warmth and the Horatian social aesthetic of course depends upon a set of material under-girdings that many will consider lead to a consumerist aesthetic—in the end, like Auden, I prefer ‘poems’ to ‘poetry’.   Pound wrote dismissively (was it in his <em>ABC of  Reading</em>?) of Cowper that he was simply doing in poetry what was being better done by the novel at the time, that his pastoral work would be unthinkable without the novel. By contrast, I think of that as a virtue, since I want to make poetry more expansive rather than more pure. In the same way, I rather like the novelettish autobiographical narrative poem. </p>

<p>There is an idea that is floating about (chiefly among poets) that poetry is somehow in the twentieth century the marker of true literature, and that it shouldn't be infected by less pure modes of cognition or narration or argumentation such as one finds in the feature film, the novel or the dialogue. Perhaps this is true. Let me, however, suggest a heresy: that the sum total of emotion, intellect, music, image and argument has sometimes been most fully achieved by poetry, but, at other times in the course of history, other art forms carry (as Pound would say) a greater ‘charge’.  Naturally, none of the above excuses bad writing by anyone, but I do think that it's interesting that one of my favourite poems written avowedly under the hermetic influence of the Cambridge school is in fact by Charles Lambert, whose main métier is as a novelist, and whose poem ‘The Gift’ (which may be found on his <a href="http://charles-lambert.blogspot.com/search/label/poem">blog</a>) deals with a recognizable human situation with much in the way of disciplined emotional sustenance. Perhaps when more of the linguistic innovation and experimental sensibilities of the avant-garde can be put to the service of what one may refer as an understanding of the human condition, a Leavisite ‘view of life’, then it will reclaim its mantle  as the standard bearer of the arts, and, with changes in the draconian authoritarian publishing conditions, wonderful poetry in a contemporary mode (not the sheer complacent boredom of the American New Formalists nor, for all his integrity, the unreadable aridity of Ulli Freer) can be read and enjoyed widely again. Here's hoping.</p>
