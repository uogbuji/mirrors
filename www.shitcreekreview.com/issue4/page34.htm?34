<p>With the regularity of food health scares  and the reproductive tendencies of rabbits, posts and articles warning that  poetry is dying circulate the online poetry world. The cyber-Cassandras seem to follow two main  themes: that only poets read poetry and that the internet is making it too easy  for bad poets to share their work. Are we afraid that we&rsquo;ll either be swept  away on a tide of poetasters and doggerelists or spin in ever tightening  reading circles until we become some sort of literary Ouroboros?</p>
<p>I have been involved in on-line poetry for  a decade now and have come to believe that, paradoxically, the internet narrows  our view instead of broadening it. Online, the focus all becomes about who is  being published where, which workshops have the best poets or critics and who  is considered &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; to post at the self-styled &ldquo;elite&rdquo; boards. Is it  any wonder that online poetry feels like a closed community?</p>
<p>My own view, from South West England,  is that poetry is alive and vibrant to those willing to get out there and find  it. Given sufficient resources, I could easily spend more than three-quarters  of the year travelling from one literature festival to another. As it is, I  attend two festivals every year and get to others whenever possible. </p>
<p>Literature festivals have been getting a  bad press&mdash;perhaps not undeservedly&mdash;for filling their programmes with talking  heads who are selling their latest (ghost-written) biographies.&nbsp;  However, the good stuff and most of the poetry happens at the fringe  events which are well worth seeking out. Festivals that are exclusively about  poetry, such as Ledbury, Aldburgh, and <em>StAnza</em> at St Andrews, can offer total immersions that should sate the most starved poet  or poetry reader.</p>
<p>Festivals can seem rather insular though,  much as I enjoy them, and can be self-consciously aware of trends in  publishing&mdash;a bit too quick to laud the latest &lsquo;young turk&rsquo;. To find living,  breathing poetry, I go to local live events: although I should declare a bias as  I run a monthly poetry caf&eacute; here in Cheltenham with established guest poets and open mic. Around three years ago,  I mentioned to a few people that it would be great if we had a regular event  apart from the festival. They said, &ldquo;Yes, great! Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s  another story.</p>
<p>Apart from the monthly event that I host,  there are a half-dozen similar events within an hour&rsquo;s drive and I get to them  when I can. For me, hearing established poets read deepens my appreciation of  their works in ways that long study of their writings rarely does. It must be  said that my reaction isn&rsquo;t always positive but even disappointing readings are  learning experiences.</p>
<p>Then there are open mics, the subject of  considerable scorn in some circles. It seems to be considered received wisdom  that open mics are stuffed with angry young poets shouting socio-political  tirades; droopy Pre-Raphaelite types (of any age!) bleeding all over the stage  from shards in broken hearts; or cozy older folk with sentimental or  humour-driven doggerel. My experience has been very different. I often hear  good poetry at open mics and it isn&rsquo;t unusual to see established poets turning  up to read. (By &ldquo;established&rdquo;, I refer to those whose names regularly appear in  reputable print journals or who can command fees for guest spots.) Furthermore,  it is always a thrill to find a new voice with something special to offer.</p>
  For my own part, there is no better way of  finding out if a poem works, since reading to an audience is entirely different  from reading aloud to oneself. The lumps and bumps soon become apparent. Open  mics can also be a rich source of inspiration as they attract so many  &ldquo;characters&rdquo;. I met one man, in his eighties, who spent all his time travelling  around poetry festivals and open mics distributing copies of his poems to  anyone who expressed a liking for them. I can think of many worse ways to <em>rage against the dying of the light</em>. </p>
<p>There are, of course, some pretty bad poets  at open mics, but even the worst of them can surprise with a startling image,  or sound combination, or theme that makes me sit up and take notice. They are  all part of the energy that builds when creative people are willing to be  vulnerable. Even the most polite and generous audience will show a difference  in reaction to differing quality so I won&rsquo;t criticize anyone for having the  courage to get up there and test themselves. When it comes down to it, for me,  poetry is an expression of humanity: humanity can be funny, sad, tedious,  glorious, loving, angry and always fallible. Open mics are where we may find  poetry when it&rsquo;s most human and alive.</p><br>
