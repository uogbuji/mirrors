My muse returned from war. Her swollen stumps 
<br>
were wrapped in rags and paper as she pumped 
<br>
her arms and pushed her yellow skateboard down 
<br>
the sidewalk. Amity is back in town 
<br>
and living in my basement now. I hear 
<br>
her castors on the floor at night&#8212;I'm near 
<br>
exhaustion, with my inspiration stuck 
<br>
for benefits despite her service. Luck 
<br>

<br>
would have it, sleep is not among her needs. 
<br>
There's constant feeding, though, and when she bleeds&#8212; 
<br>
it happens intermittently&#8212;my heart 
<br>
contracts and ices up. I have to start 
<br>
compression on the remnant of her thigh. 
<br>
She gently strokes my hair, and then a sigh 
<br>
I never heard in all her teasing days 
<br>
accompanies an unfamiliar gaze 
<br>
<br>
from eyes that used to tell me something strange. 
<br>
They've lost their mystery. As I arrange 
<br>
a knee-high desk for Amity, prepare 
<br>
myself to take dictation, I'm aware 
<br>
she's crossed a line. I used to chase her form, 
<br>
those perfect thighs, her arms and hair would storm 
<br>
into my life and leave me nights of sweet 
<br>
fulfillment or frustration. God, her feet, 
<br>

<br>
the perpetrators of the vixen's trick 
<br>
of disappearing for a week&#8212;a stick, 
<br>
now, and that slab on wheels. I couldn't touch 
<br>
her then, yet here I dress her wounds. So much 
<br>
has changed since Amity embedded with 
<br>
the wind, "Before the Fire!" her shibboleth. 
<br>
It echoes in my soul&#8212;the soul that longed 
<br>
to lie with Amity, the soul so wronged 
<br>

<br>
and yet rewarded. Now, I want to sleep. 
<br>
but I'm on call, her needs are dire, and deep 
<br>
into the night my ministrations plait 
<br>
a prelude to the work that she claims fate 
<br>
prefigures. "Canto I," her voice, without 
<br>
its old élan, surprises through a bout 
<br>
of smoker's cough and red encoded warning, 
<br>
"Engines that You Heard on Tuesday Morning."
