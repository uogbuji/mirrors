<blockquote><p style="font-size:90%"><b>My Molly You Were Spying</b>
<br /><br />
You saw us walk out of the movies<br />
dazed from a bear like darkness<br />
arm in arm; I had just spilled<br />
popcorn over her dress and<br />
she clung to me in the scary parts.<br /><br />

You questioned me about whom I was with.<br />
Always the correctness of inflection<br />
and the despotism of will. Amid the fierce<br />
Christmas lights of the mall, I looked<br />
for exits and saw your black cascading hair<br />
that fell so justly over your eyes.<br /><br />

Now they were sad as I introduced my<br />
new companion; and I was suddenly<br />
bereft of vision and wondered why<br />
I could never make commitment.<br />
I watched you on the down escalator.<br />
Didn’t you belong in bed?<br /><br />

My Molly why were you spying<br />
or was it mere accident<br />
and retribution?<br />
What a waste of sweetness.<br />
And so I had my newest partner<br />
in my closet for a while.<br /><br />

At last I remembered your tears<br />
over a tin of hot chocolate<br />
and wept for all my perversities<br />
that gathered in my cup—<br />
the dregs of feeling all alone again<br />
without my faithful skeleton.<br /><br />

“The situation of a woman in some version of that-culture-in-which-we-all-exist may be described as the desirous reader. She is the reader desiring something, some thing not yet there, perhaps partially there, fleetingly there, oppositionally there, reductively there; if there, perhaps unread, and unread is unseen, unheard.” (DuPlessis, Rachel.  The Pink Guitar: Writing as Feminist Practice. London: Routledge, 1990, p.120.)</p></blockquote>


<p>How do we read each other? In a culture-within-a-culture, such as the lesbian culture within the mainstream culture, signs and languages may go untranslated. Nevertheless, the delicate dance of amour is always accompanied by the music of one culture or another. The choreographer understands both the dance and the music. In “My Molly You Were Spying,” the poet, Judith Rechter, is the choreographer, creating the dance for three dancers: the narrator, the new companion/partner, and the former companion/partner. </p>

<p>The poem is presented simply, in five stanzas, with average-length lines, without any further formal or metrical patterns. And yet, the poem is clearly well-formed and whole. What makes it so? The image of the eye, for one. Look for words related to the eye or seeing: saw, movies, looked, saw, vision, watched, spying, tears, wept. Seeing, here, is understanding, and this poem reminds us that understanding means love, acceptance, kindness. Of course, in our culture, there can be no kindness without sadness. See how sadness and kindness are simultaneously expressed with such exquisite poignancy in these lines:</p> <blockquote><p style="font-size:90%">

I watched you on the down escalator.<br />
Didn’t you belong in bed?</p></blockquote>

<p>Where do these three dancers belong? In the bear like darkness of the movies? Amid the fierce Christmas lights of the mall? On the escalator? In bed? In the closet? In the dregs of feeling? Are they coming out of the movies? Looking for exits? What potion or goddess is available for these three dancers?  “Here comes Sappho, scorching the history books with tongues of flame.” (Jeanette Winterson) Listen, Aphrodite is speaking:</p><blockquote>

<p style="font-size:90%">"Who again convince? What quick friendship<br>
do you want? Who hurts you<br>
this time?<br>
Does she run? Then she'll chase.<br>
Didn't like the gifts? Then she'll give them.<br>
She does not love? Soon.<br>
No choice for her."</p></blockquote>

<p>Click <a href="http://www.agendapoetry.co.uk/featured-translations4.php">here</a> to read “Love and the Trick-Stitching Child” translated from Sappho by Brian Carr. I introduce this poem because I hear a similarity of tone, in the direct questioning and intimate poignancy, with “My Molly You Were Spying.” Also, the former companion/partner is goddess-like, with her “black cascading hair” and possible retribution. </p>

<p>Editors reading this poem may feel an urgent need to hyphenate “bear like”. But the poet’s deliberate idiosyncrasy announces, in the second line, that the culture evoked in the poem is different from the culture at large, more animistic perhaps, a simile with metaphorical aspirations. </p>

<p>One might conclude that this poem’s form is a steady unfolding of dramatic scenes, evenly spaced. The eye’s focus moves from public culture (movie, mall, Christmas), turns on the public/private culture of bed (the poem’s ne plus ultra), enters the privacy of the closet (storage, hiding), and ends all alone with a release of tears (insight). </p><br>
