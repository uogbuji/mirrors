<p>The crowded room might as well have been lit by candles. A poet was trying to read his own writing by the burnt-out stage lights, to an audience of forty familiar faces, regulars at this weekly open poetry reading. His words crackled out of mounted speakers. Almost everyone was listening attentively, aside from some hushed drink orders at the bar, & one table that wouldn’t stop reveling. </p>

<p>Two drunk playboys were mocking the poet to their dates&#8212;off-duty strippers, by the look of their evening wear. After a round of applause, the poet stepped down. The emcee leapt to the mic, & said, “Hey, guys, you’ll get your turn a bit later, but for now could you respect the poets, & shut the fuck up?” The louder of the two playboys stood up. He had often lauded himself as a major talent. He knew all his own poems by heart. He often broke into song, mid-poem. He boasted of reading in New York City. He was big time. He shouted at the audience, “You don’t deserve me!” The emcee drawled, “You got that right. Hit the road.” Then he called the next reader on the list. </p>

<p>This was poetry in Houston, Texas. Other reading groups, each catering to a particular enclave&#8212;students, teachers, activists, feminists, Gays, street poets&#8212;popped up on a regular basis, & folded once attendance fell off. This place was the mainstay, the middle ground, where all the disparate fringes mingled. <b>Helios</b>, originally a coffeehouse, opened its doors ten years before to any & all types of bohemian activity. Its liquor license made it a bar, but its roster of events made it a cultural center: theatre, jazz, belly-dancing, stand-up, goth bands, & every Wednesday night, poetry. For six of those ten years, I was the poetry coordinator. </p>

<p>At eight or so, I’d walk in with a pack of index cards. The bartender was supposed to have a microphone behind the bar, & maybe a stand. The sound system was supposed to work. Sometimes a key piece of equipment had just been broken or stolen by a band the night before. I would keep a spare mic, a stand, & a portable amp in my trunk. Sometimes I’d have to change the light bulb over the stage. Whenever possible, I’d commandeer the jukebox, playing some Sex Pistols to set the mood.</p>

<p>As people arrived, I would start handing index cards to anyone who wanted to read. A card got you up to three poems or nine minutes, whichever came first. No preference to one style or another. On any given night you might hear a poem protesting the government’s infringement on Lakota rights, a rhyme against Governor Rick Perry, a confession of addiction, a rap about ghetto life, a blues for children’s television, a lament about growing old, or a ballade about chicken soup. Even the odd bit of cowboy poetry. Come one, come all. I heard the local Writing Program poets once called us “Bad Poetry night,” but then they started to hang around, too. Unlike the other venues, you never knew what kind of mix we would have. Our readings gave everyone a regular outlet, a bowl of poetic gumbo, a place to listen, a place to be heard. </p>

<p>We ran all through the year, even through school holidays. It could be very hot in the summer, which in Houston lasts about half a year. When we ran the window-unit air-conditioner, you could barely hear the poets. When we didn’t, we’d, um, perspire. If we left the doors open, mosquitoes came in to feed on the creative atmosphere. Sirens often passed on the street outside. One time, police entered during a reading; a suspect from a nearby shooting had been seen running through the neighborhood, but the officers must have doubted a criminal would stop somewhere for culture. (I must keep that in mind, next time I’m eluding capture.)</p>

<p>I asked some of the regulars to take turns emceeing, rotating four a month for a year, then changing out. I picked from different cliques to keep any one group from getting the upper hand. When someone among us came out with a chapbook or a CD, we gave them the spotlight. For traveling poets, we were a stop on the circuit.</p>

<p>To keep things interesting, we’d come up with special events. Every year, as close as possible to October 20, we held a birthday party for Symbolist poet Arthur Rimbaud. We staged a poetic transgender Celebrity Deathmatch between Sylvia Plath & Ted Hughes’ poems, when <i>The Birthday Letters</i> came out. We also held a group reading of <i>Howl</i> for its forty-fifth anniversary, & <i>The Waste Land</i> for its seventy-fifth. The night of the Eliot reading, one of our readers, a sonorous Mexican-American Marxist called the bar at the last minute to tell me he could not participate. He had decided that the “hooded hordes” in the desert was an unflattering portrait of “his people,” & he could not in good conscience perform the work of an imperialist. I found someone with no such qualms to fill in for him.</p>

<p>One of our hosts came up with the Poem Swap. One week a month we’d ask each poet to bring in a copy of a new poem, one legible enough to read by crappy light, without the poet’s name on it. The poems would go into a bag, & then, each poet would blindly select someone else’s poem. We’d have someone start off by reading the poem thus selected, & then the audience would shout out, trying to guess who had written it. The regulars, of course, built up some familiarity with each other’s voices. A tell-tale word or stylistic flourish would often give enough of a clue to give them a fighting chance. Once the poet was guessed (or revealed) he or she would read the next poem. This could get quite rowdy, especially if the guesses transgressed gender or other boundaries. Poets would often bring some of their most scathing work for the Swap. The game proved most popular with the crowd.      </p>

<p>One Wednesday before Thanksgiving, we had expected the turn-out to be low. We’d thought the students would be off on a school break, & the others would be staying home with their families. But that’s not how it worked out. The crowd had overflowed onto the front patio. All the sign-up cards were taken, signed, & turned in; people wanted to read. We had a full night ahead of us. Then, there was a power failure. Only the bluish back-lighting behind the bar continued to glow. I have no idea why; perhaps it was on a separate grid. We had no other illumination. We had no amplification. All we had was poetry. So we read in the dark over the most attentive crowd ever. The crowded room might as well have been lit by candles.</p><br>
