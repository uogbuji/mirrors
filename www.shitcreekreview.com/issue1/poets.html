<font face="Arial" class="fsx05"><B>Mark Allinson: </B>was born in 1947 and raised in Melbourne, Australia. At first Mark believed that he wanted to be an airline pilot, and he completed a private flying licence at 17. Before long, however, he realized that flying was merely a metaphor of his desire to rise above the pettiness of daily life, in order to see the big picture. Eventually this desire for vertical transcendence led to a Ph.D in English literature, and he taught for a while at Monash University, in Melbourne. Mark is now entirely grounded, and living and writing on the NSW coast, south of Sydney.<br>
