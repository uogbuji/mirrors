He lives now with his family in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, a stone's throw from the churchyard where Thomas Gray is buried; still hoping that one day something of these poets will rub off on him.

She loves having the time now (not to mention a paddle) to be what she wanted to be when she grew up. More of her work can be seen at <a href="http://imagineii.typepad.com/imagineii/">http://imagineii.typepad.com/imagineii/</a></a></p><p><a name="artbio345"><b>Mark Bulwinkle</b>&nbsp; artist, B. 1946 Boston Mass., lives in Oakland, Ca. Former student of Robert J. Clawson, Weston, Mass. Google Mark Bulwinkle, artist, or see <a href="http://www.markbulwinkle.com">www.markbulwinkle.com</a>. His 'Steelhead and Sun frolic in River' adorns the front page of SCR, and many other creekish spots as well.</a></p><p><a name="artbio333"><b>Donald Zirilli</b>&nbsp; thinks he's a rebel and he'll never ever ever ever ever ever ever be any good. At all.</a></p><p><a name="artbio334"><b>Tanzy Keiko Mai</b>&nbsp; provided the artwork for our editorial pages. Born in ‘76, she is a mostly female 
self- taught confounded thing residing in Texas.

She has five fabulous siblings whom she adores.

Her relationship with art is like that of two or more scorned passive aggressive co-dependent lovers. 
One of which may or may not be deceased. 
Her relationship with poetry however is happy and constant, parallel to, but unlike mathematics.

In the company of her artwork there is no distinction between multiple realities 
with this quasi-cartoon, light-hearted, moderately disturbed, partially dark humored approach 
to the undercurrents of a not so charmed life in a world that is peculiarly delightful, 
but dreadfully wicked.

She hopes that the viewer of her art is able to see a silver lining despite circumstance 
and more importantly, that one’s imagination is sparked. 

Cheers to La-Di-Daism and thank you kindly for your interest.</a></p></div>
