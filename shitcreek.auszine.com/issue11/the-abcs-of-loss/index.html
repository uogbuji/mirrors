				<h1>the ABCs of loss</h1>
				 <h2 class="author_byline">by <a href = "../contributors/index.html#bio423" title="About the author">Peter Schwartz</a></h2><div id="post"><div id="poem"><br /><p>A.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m losing my accent, an animal forgetting<br />
itself in parts; two-thirds arms, three-quarter legs, my body<br />
a memory of three meals and lots of books</p>
<p>I sit in my hardest chair, playing in my inner deportation center<br />
wrestling to see what I&#8217;ll have to abandon tonight, testing the<br />
next story against the others, they say</p>
<p>all losses are imagined, but I&#8217;ve stepped out of my-<br />
self so many times there&#8217;s a grudge in that doorway<br />
a blockade of flies taking away</p>
<p>from the meat of<br />
what we&#8217;ve meant</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>at fifteen, I give up the word gravity and float around for days<br />
I disturb nothing in our rented house, I consider us a museum<br />
in that we always have something to come back to</p>
<p>I&#8217;m only the more lonely of its curators, my father bangs me<br />
against the walls like a cheap prostitute, I blacked out after the first time<br />
I failed science</p>
<p>I woke four-fifths gone, one-fifth<br />
wanting my glasses back</p>
<p>C.</p>
<p>at sixteen, I am a piñata for almost everything, the world shakes even<br />
as the grandparents visit us in jersey, an ant colony under a blurry microscope<br />
but they are getting the sense dad doesn&#8217;t leave the house</p>
<p>most days he lays in the backyard, a weird dinosaur<br />
on a plastic lounge chair trying to change psychiatry<br />
and the english language, other</p>
<p>days he takes it out on us, he obsesses over my education<br />
until I don&#8217;t want to know anything which is good<br />
because another word for this is humility</p>
<p>D.</p>
<p>anyone who has begged too hard for too long is of a slightly different species<br />
I built spaceships to breath in my bedroom, borrowed oxygen from the television<br />
trying to wait out that silver storm, I left</p>
<p>large parts of my heart in the furniture<br />
I signed cards to my dark side, open-ended, to whom it may concern<br />
because I wasn&#8217;t sure who was there</p>
<p>we all get caught playing nobody<br />
but some of us stay that way, I&#8217;m nobody because of<br />
the silences I&#8217;ve accepted</p>
<p>E.</p>
<p>random mortar took over, afternoons of cartoons floated in from the vents<br />
a little less real every day, I lost the word sad in my piggy bank<br />
but I could taste it, mom cooked rice to hide our sins</p>
<p>we ate meals tinged with a violence none of us could explain<br />
I predicted victims like a weatherman, my mother and brother<br />
switched chairs as I chose another bruise</p>
<p>in a blacker purple, this might be the difference<br />
between you and me, I don&#8217;t see faces as anything<br />
real or beautiful</p>
<p>F.</p>
<p>at twelve, I write lyrics for my dog, he jumps out of our chevy<br />
and a few days later the bird dies, I stuff my shirt with newspaper<br />
and sleep in the breezeway</p>
<p>years later I&#8217;ll pee in jars because I&#8217;m too scared to see anyone<br />
my mother lines up twenty white pills because dad fucked the asian baby-<br />
sitter back in new york, she starts melting so</p>
<p>I call 911 and while I wait for the ambulance<br />
turn into a very old man with no body: nobody<br />
I understand the concept of a corpse</p>
<p>J.</p>
<p>variations of sleep, we&#8217;ve woke as worse<br />
my brother and I are entirely different pets, he, my father&#8217;s, stabs hamsters<br />
and molested our cat missy, while I, my mother&#8217;s</p>
<p>want to be alone in an almost supernatural way<br />
my guess is none of my teachers wanted to face the black hole<br />
I play dead in, one birthday</p>
<p>J. drops acid and has a grand mal seizure<br />
spends the next three years at the four winds mental institution<br />
I visit twice, most of him is</p>
<p>missing but he doesn&#8217;t ask for anything<br />
I can see how seriously he takes his escape<br />
it&#8217;s in me too</p>
<p>M.</p>
<p>my father was a moderately famous psychiatrist once upon a time<br />
he understood the principles of what could break and what could heal a man<br />
and so he became my judge and executioner</p>
<p>passing out white candy for my better performances<br />
and crushing me when I stuttered, he molded me into a camel<br />
and no the ocean in my hump is</p>
<p>in no danger of bursting, there&#8217;s an erotic side to every beating<br />
so I know my father well enough to know he understands it will take<br />
years for us to get human again</p>
<p>S.</p>
<p>surrender took us to quiet places when dad started hitting harder<br />
he found us there too, repeatedly, as the room became a submarine<br />
I once put up a white flag</p>
<p>and hit his arm in the car hoping we&#8217;d crash and you and mom<br />
could live some soft new life somewhere far from that suburbia<br />
from the invisible graveyard</p>
<p>growing in our basement, I<br />
wanted that life for you two<br />
that badly</p>
<p>Z.</p>
<p>my brother, my mother, my father and me<br />
we took vacations in each other, played our nightmare roles for academy awards<br />
I was the star, my mother the audience, my brother</p>
<p>the supporting cast, my father, the director and producer, screamed action<br />
and we all survived in place, playing dead loudly, pretending in and out of<br />
ourselves like animals</p>
<p>years later I&#8217;m obsessed with dictionaries, with verbs and history<br />
with killing seeds, with archetypes, with thresholds, with strength<br />
and purity, with accents</p>
<p>Z.</p>
<p>my mother stood between some shots, side-stepped others<br />
my brother had seven pairs of blue corduroys and seven blue T-shirts<br />
because my father was in charge of school supplies</p>
<p>he joked it was his victim uniform, I dressed beautifully because<br />
part of me was still a woman for dad, rumor has it last Halloween<br />
a kid was killed by the police</p>
<p>years later I openly shoplift for the rush of getting caught<br />
the handcuffs, the cell, the call to my parents, I&#8217;m flirting with<br />
being someone else&#8217;s prisoner</p>
