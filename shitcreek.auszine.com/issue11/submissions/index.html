				<h1>Submissions</h1>
				 <div id="post"><div id="entry"><p style="font-size:130%;font-weight:bold;">Theme for Issue #12</p>
<p><b>A Fetish for Good Poetry</b></p>
<p style="margin-left:35px;">Ah thy people, thy children, thy chosen,<br />
Marked cross from the womb and perverse!<br />
<small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;from Swinburne&#8217;s &#8220;Dolores&#8221;</small></p>
<p>It took nerve, in Swinburne&#8217;s day, to be &#8220;perverse&#8221; and proud of it; and even today, it&#8217;s the rare poet who explores this theme with any real insight or empathy.</p>
<p>We&#8217;d like to devote an issue to poetry that deals with kinks or fetishes in an artful way. Humor is okay as long as it&#8217;s not retrograde, but we&#8217;re more interested in odes and aubades, musings and memoirs. We&#8217;re not looking for self-conscious posturing, corny stereotypes, bad puns, or naive &#8220;yuk yuk&#8221; verse. Let&#8217;s see how high we can set the bar.</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;font-weight:bold;">Deadline for Issue #12</p>
<p>May 31, 2010</p>
<p>PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT WORK AFTER THIS DATE until we announce what the theme for SCR #13 will be. That announcement will occur within issue #12.</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;font-weight:bold;">Possible Submission Routes</p>
<p>Please read all the guidelines before submitting.</p>
<ul>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="mailto:kd@kdkaboom.com" style="color:black;border-bottom:1px black dotted;">Email ART submissions for Issue #12</a> to our guest art editor, the fabulous Katy Maslow.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="../../../www.shitcreekreview.com/submitonline.html" style="color:black;border-bottom:1px black dotted;">The Shit Creek Magic Online Submission Form</a>—an easy way to submit if you’re just sending a poem or two without much, or complex, formatting. (You will receive an automated response showing your text as received.)</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="mailto:editor@shitcreekreview.com" style="color:black;border-bottom:1px black dotted;">Plain-text email</a>, if your text contains no significant formatting.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;"><a href="mailto:editor@shitcreekreview.com" style="color:black;border-bottom:1px black dotted;">Formatted (HTML) email</a> with your text in the body of the message. If necessary, you can copy into the message from a Word or other document.</li>
<li><a href="mailto:editor@shitcreekreview.com" style="color:black;border-bottom:1px black dotted;">Email with an attached RTF file</a>. We recommend the attachment route for longer prose work or any work with complex formatting (indents, step breaks, lots of italics, and so on).</li>
</ul>
<p style="font-size:130%;font-weight:bold;">General Submission Guidelines</p>
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;"><em>The Shit Creek Review </em>will publish bi-annually in February-ish and July-ish, and seeks to present high-quality original work in the fields of poetry and art.</strong></li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Submission deadline dates and themes for the next issue will be specified in each current issue.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">In poetry, we are biased towards formalism, but by no means dismissive of vers libre. We are looking for original work which deals with a wide variety of issues and imagery, including that which might test or challenge boundaries, or disturb sensibilities. But it must be well executed. Please do not send us work which has not been extensively drafted, crafted and polished.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Previous publication is not a problem as long as the previous publisher does not hold copyright. You must inform us of any previous publication when you submit. Posting to blogs or online workshops is not in our opinion publishing, so any such poems or other pieces are clearly eligible. We reserve the right to archive your work as part of this site, and with your specific consent to publish it in a print anthology later; but all other rights remain with the author.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">The person who submits work must be the original author.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">We accept simultaneous submissions, but please inform us immediately if the submission is accepted elsewhere.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Poets should submit 1 &#8211; 5 poems. Contributions should be sent in the body of an email, or as .rtf file attachments if necessary to preserve formatting: text contributions, whether poetry or prose, should be single-spaced.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">If you sent your submission in an .rtf file attachment, please name the file according to the following formula:<br />
<blockquote><p>Surname Poems.rtf</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Yeats Poems.rtf</p></blockquote>
<p>This procedure is not mandatory but will make the editors&#8217; work a little easier. </li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Please include your surname and the word “Submission” in the subject line of your email, thus:<br />
<blockquote><p>Surname Submission</p>
<p><em>Example:</em> Yeats Submission</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Do not send us sound files unless requested to do so. If your work is selected for SCR we may invite you to contribute mp3 files of yourself reading it, but in that eventuality we will contact you.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Visual arts contributions should be as .jpeg files and may be sent as attachments. Image submissions should be original work or cite relevant permissions from copyright owners.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">All contributors should include brief third person biographical details of up to five lines.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">We will attempt to acknowledge receipt of all submissions within four weeks of arrival, but cannot promise to do so.</li>
<li style="margin-bottom:10px;">Payment for publication in <em>The Shit Creek Review</em> is not possible in this life, but contributors will be rewarded in the next. On the other hand the editors are very receptive to offers (redeemable in this life) of cash bribes, vouchers, favours, and so forth.</li>
