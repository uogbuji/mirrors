			<p>1.<br />
For fear of what I might find there, for fear<br />
alone &#8212; that trembling companion squirreled deep<br />
down in the crawl space. For it once was here,<br />
as natural as a limb before the creep<br />
of foreign tongues licked at my ears and sheer<br />
delight hobbled my sense. For fear the steep<br />
set of stairs descended and I would descend<br />
with it. For fear, my friend, of the tenuis end.</p>
<p>That, the easiest path. Those lightning minds<br />
that climbed from interred sleep and shattered the pact,<br />
illumined a naked thought &#8212; the thing that binds<br />
the fact of matter to the matter of fact&#8230;.<br />
Do you hear? They are here among us, speaking. The blinds<br />
are drawn and redrawn, a burning crease shellacked.<br />
There are fragments on the stairs and I descend<br />
with them, in fear (or hope) that they will end.</p>
<p>A grazing mist tugs at my back. A chill<br />
deceives a well-placed step and steals the shock<br />
of impact. Does the mind remember fleeting will,<br />
the body lost blood, or will the splintered clock<br />
recall the time it kept now that it&#8217;s still?<br />
I&#8217;ve not forgotten you. This simple lock<br />
corroded long ago and falls to dust<br />
with a well-aimed breath &#8212; the inviting door must&#8230;.</p>
<p>2.<br />
No rats disperse beneath the planks; no bats<br />
design translucent arcs, signaling change,<br />
but cymbals flood the band of light, high hats<br />
in tow. A naked bulb still lights a fixed range,<br />
and ashes and earth collect all things. The cats<br />
I&#8217;d grown to love are stuffed (improved from the mange)<br />
and civilly propped in sprung poses below<br />
a snapshot mobile, dead faces twisting so slow.</p>
<p>This space is crammed with busy voices, rows<br />
of roses tagged with unfamiliar hair,<br />
exhausted shotgun shells, discarded clothes,<br />
all utterances of self-worth and despair.<br />
A polished steel box tied with razor blade bows<br />
is guarded by a ring of misplaced prayer.<br />
A shadow tumbles back into the wall,<br />
amazed that I was able to move at all.</p>
<p>But over there a mattress, indented, soiled<br />
with scattered leaves and bound by leaden tomes,<br />
their corners carefully creased, as if one toiled<br />
infinite nights siphoning thought from poems<br />
the world would never see, siphoning oiled<br />
associations whose thinning echo still roams<br />
to greet receptive ears and disconnect<br />
their streaming thoughts with a prying dialect.</p>
<p>3.<br />
And tucked behind a bureau of receipts,<br />
a naked creature lies, its mouth sewn shut,<br />
emaciated from thought and bruised from deceits<br />
that have gathered currency, bypassing the glut<br />
of filtered tears. It wags its toe through the beats<br />
it&#8217;s forced to hear, wipes spittle from the cut<br />
below its lips and thinks but none of this<br />
is mine &#8212; a history we can&#8217;t dismiss&#8230;.</p>
<p>I have not forgotten you, my naked friend,<br />
but you are what I fear: the coal-hard thought<br />
that could ignite and dress me for the end.<br />
Why must I chance this living flesh to the rot<br />
of the sudden earth? Why must you always send<br />
me to darker planes? If it were joy I sought,<br />
I&#8217;d never come at all, but patiently wait<br />
in borrowed clothes at the arrivals gate.</p>
<p>But here I am &#8212; unclothed, exposing the scars<br />
from prior dates &#8212; with a promise not to flee.<br />
Consume me if you want; fasten the bars;<br />
let all I&#8217;ve gathered burn. The nearing sea<br />
doesn&#8217;t worry about the shore; nor failing stars<br />
the fate of its light: it&#8217;s all a gas, you see,<br />
the elemental parts at the costume ball<br />
beholden to shapes they did not want at all.</p>
