			<p><em>WWII</em></p>
<p>Jen&#8217;s brother, back from Palestine,<br />
quick marched himself into our lives<br />
and what a holy show it was.<br />
He spanned our hearth from hob to hob<br />
an ancient statue brought to life<br />
in gleaming bronze. A smiling, lithe<br />
Colossus with a cup of tea<br />
and buttered bread. As Stentor, he<br />
would call the cattle in. &#8220;C&#8217;maawn!<br />
C&#8217;ma-a-a-a-wn!&#8221; The echoes just fair tore<br />
us both apart. Our mouths agape,<br />
we&#8217;d always be there, in the way.<br />
and if we fell, then he&#8217;d bend down<br />
and pick us up and spin us round.<br />
It made us feel as though we were<br />
full grown and hanging on his words,<br />
we fell in love. He&#8217;d speak to us<br />
of what he&#8217;d seen and what he&#8217;d done<br />
but he was quiet when the mob<br />
came round all hungry for a spot<br />
of tea and news. We felt so proud<br />
that it was only us he found<br />
worth talking to.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</span>The river was<br />
our secret place. We&#8217;d picnic on<br />
the bend and swim, but only when<br />
no-one was near. One day we let<br />
him come with us but told him flat<br />
he mustn&#8217;t look. He turned his back<br />
and laughed. He said he&#8217;d thought we&#8217;d be<br />
much more grown up than that. Slowly<br />
we both undressed and nothing was<br />
the same again.</p>
<p><span style="color: #ffffff;">..    &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</span>Then he was gone.<br />
The Military Police had stopped<br />
outside the pub. They pulled him out<br />
handcuffed and bleeding from the mouth.<br />
He fell and we could smell his fear,<br />
but worse, he sobbed. One yelled out &#8220;Ere&#8217;s<br />
a gutless bastard &#8216;oo &#8216;uz ran<br />
and left his mates behind!&#8221;. They dragged<br />
him up and tossed him in the van<br />
We hunkered down behind our Dad.<br />
Mum stared at us and hauled us home.<br />
We pray real hard we&#8217;re not&#8230; you know.</p>
