			<p>At Ostende, the sea more black than blue;<br />
and Bruges was mostly dark canals and white<br />
lace antimacassars; she made me eat<br />
<em>moules</em> for the first time, we both learned to drink<br />
the amber Flemish beers and, thinking back,<br />
there was a woman once, and she was tall.</p>
<p>There was a woman once and she was tall;<br />
radiant, in an awkward way, with blue<br />
eyes set too far apart, but her naked back<br />
felt like silk, and her short-cropped, near-white<br />
street waif hair looked swell behind a drink,<br />
but what we liked to do the most was eat.</p>
<p>And what we liked to do the most was eat<br />
our way across Manhattan, she was tall,<br />
and life was good; the sex and food and drink<br />
were good &#8212; weekends, sometimes, we&#8217;d hit the <em>Blue</em><br />
<em>Note</em> down on Hudson, hip crowd, black and white,<br />
and we left something there we can&#8217;t get back.</p>
<p>And there was something there we can&#8217;t get back,<br />
but what we liked to do the most was eat;<br />
that time in Kyoto, the shoji screens all white,<br />
there was a woman there, and she was tall;<br />
grilled squid, the platter glazed dark brown and blue,<br />
hot saké, served in little cups, the drink.</p>
<p>Hot saké, served in little cups, to drink,<br />
and there was something there we can&#8217;t get back,<br />
a sense of loss, unreachable and blue,<br />
but what we liked we liked the most was eat.<br />
There was a woman once, and she was tall,<br />
her eyes were Baltic blue, her hair was white.</p>
<p>Her pretty eyes were blue, her hair was white.<br />
Hot saké served in little cups to drink.<br />
There was a woman once, and she was tall.<br />
And something there was there we can&#8217;t get back.<br />
But what we liked to do the most was eat.<br />
Her hair white, white, so pretty eyes blue blue.</p>
<p>A woman once, go back, her eyes blue blue.<br />
Her she so white, so tall, we loved drink eat.<br />
Blue, white, back, drink, eat, eat, tall, tall tall tall.</p>
