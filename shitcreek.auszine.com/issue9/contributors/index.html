He was educated at Hull Grammar School and St Catherine's College, Oxford, where he studied modern history.

His life has been spent in the near aura of famous poets: Dafydd ap Gwilym, greatest of the Welsh bards; Philip Larkin, one-time librarian of Hull University; Andrew Marvell, a fellow-alumnus of Hull Grammar School, though not my contemporary. He lives now with his family in Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, a stone's throw from the churchyard where Thomas Gray is buried; still hoping that one day something of these poets will rub off on him. 

 
His second poetry collection, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Talking-Newborough-David-Gwilym-Anthony/dp/0976195410" target="_blank"><em>Talking to Lord Newborough</em></a><em>,</em> was published by the Alsop Review Press in 2004.

He works in London, in financial services.
