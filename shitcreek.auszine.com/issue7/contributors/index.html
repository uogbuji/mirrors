And glad that his father, Keith, who served in the Australian Navy during the war, survived it, since if he hadn’t, Mark wouldn’t be writing poems now, in his semi-retirement on the south coast of New South Wales. Mark didn’t really start writing poetry till his 50s, and he used to keep track of his publications for a while, but he got bored with that and stopped some time ago. But you might find a few scattered around, and quite a few in back issues of this magazine, and in <i><a href="../../../www.the-chimaera.com/index.html" target="_blank">The Chimaera</a></i>, also.</a></p><p><a name="bio123"><strong>C.B.
