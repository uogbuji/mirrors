<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Submissions for Issue #8 of <em>Shit Creek Review</em> are now closed (August 5th, 2008). Issue #8, due out in September, will include an announcement of our next theme and deadline for the January Issue #9.</strong></span></p>
<p>Issue #8 of <em>The Shit Creek Review</em> is due out some time in October &#8212; if we don&#8217;t lose our paddles. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Submissions may be sent now. </span>The theme is:</p>
<p><strong>Obsession/Compulsion. Obsession, or Compulsion, or both. Yes, Obsession. Compulsion. Obsession. Or Compulsion. Both, maybe.</strong></p>
<p>So what you need to do is cleanse yourself from top-knot to toenail, wash your hands, dress in bright green robe, wearing the Good Luck Hat, wash your hands again, turn to the north and bow, turn to the east and bow twice, turn to the south and bow three times, turn to the  west and stand on one leg — all the time ensuring that you do not think of French Toast. If you think of French Toast even once you must begin the whole sequence again, starting with the initial cleansing and a new  green robe. Wash your hands. Now move towards your poem-writing desk and — Hang on! Did you just think of French Toast? Does thinking of eggs on toast count as thinking of French Toast? Damn! OK, start again. Wash your hands&#8230; Having finally reached the writing desk, lay the red pen, the purple pen and the black pen in front of you next to the sheet of white paper. Which order were the pens supposed to go in? Red-purple-black or black-purple-red. Maybe black-red-purple. Yes! Wash your hands. OK, all ready to write  the obsession/compulsion poem now. French toast. Damn!</p>
<p>Repeat as many times as is necessary to get a result, then wash your hands and send the poem (if you can bear to part with it) by express mail canoe to</p>
<p>Yr Humble &amp; Obedient Servants,</p>
<p>The Shit Creek Review Editors,</p>
<p><strong><script type="text/javascript"><!--

<p><strong><br />
Submissions for <em>The Shit Creek Review</em> October 2008 issue must be received by 4th August, 2008. Please do not submit work after this date until we announce what the theme for SCR #9 will be.</strong></p>
<p>Possible submission routes (please read all the guidelines before submitting):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">NEW!</span>—Online submission</strong> via our <a href="http://www.shitcreekreview.com/submitonline.php">Shit Creek Magic Online Submission Form</a>—an easy way to submit if you’re just sending a poem or two without much, or complex, formatting. (You will receive an automated response showing your text as received.)</li>
<li>Plain-text mail, if your text contains no significant formatting.</li>
<li>Formatted (HTML) mail with your text in the body of the message. If necessary, you can copy into the message from a Word or other document.</li>
<li>Mail with an attached Word or RTF file. We recommend the attachment route for longer prose work or any work with complex formatting (indents, step breaks, lots of italics, and so on). Preferably, don’t send a Word file unless your virus-checker will scan it; save out as RTF and send that instead.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, Shit Creek Paddlers: we know it&#8217;s not as much fun as partying: <strong>but please read all the guidelines before submitting</strong>. Other things being equal we are more likely to accept work that is easier for us to prepare for publication.</p>
<p>Artists can send image submissions to the Art Editor Don Zirilli (details below).</p>

<h2 class="sub">General Submission Guidelines</h2>
<ol>
<li><em>The Shit Creek Review </em>will publish triannually in January, May, and  September/October, and seeks to present high-quality original work in the fields of poetry and art.</li>
<li>Submission deadline dates and themes (if any) for the next issue will be specified in each current issue, but you may submit work at any time. If your submission is too late for the deadline date for one issue it will be placed in the batch for the next. But bear in mind that since most issues are themed it is sensible to submit work suitable for the relevant theme.</li>
<li>In poetry, we are biased towards formalism, but by no means dismissive of vers libre. We are looking for original work which deals with a wide variety of issues and imagery, including that which might test or challenge boundaries, or disturb sensibilities.  But it must be well executed. Please do not send us work which has not been extensively drafted, crafted and polished.</li>
<li>Previous publication is not a problem as long as the previous publisher does not hold copyright. You must inform us of any previous publication when you submit. Posting to blogs or online workshops is not in our opinion publishing, so any such poems or other pieces are clearly eligible. We reserve the right to archive your work as part of this site, and with your specific consent to publish it in a print anthology later; but all other rights remain with the author.</li>
<li>The person who submits work must be the original author.</li>
<li>We accept simultaneous submissions, but please inform us immediately if the submission is accepted elsewhere.</li>
<li>Poets should submit 1 &#8211; 5 poems. Contributions should be sent in the body of an email, or as .doc or .rtf file attachments if necessary to preserve formatting: text contributions, whether poetry or prose, should be single-spaced.</li>
<li>If you sent your submission in a .doc or .rtf file attachment, please name the file according to the following formula:<br />
<blockquote><p><strong>Surname Title of The Poem.doc (or .rtf)</strong></p>
<p><em>Example:</em>Yeats The Second Coming.doc</p></blockquote>
<p>or, if more than one poem:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Surname Poems</strong></p>
<p><em>Example:</em>Yeats Poems.doc</p></blockquote>
<p>This procedure is not mandatory but will make the editors&#8217; work a litttle easier.</li>
<li>Please include your surname and the word “Submission” in the subject line of your email, thus:<br />
<strong>Yeats Submission</strong></li>
<li><strong>Do not</strong> send us sound files unless requested to do so. If your work is selected for SCR we may invite you to contribute mp3 files of yourself reading it, but in that eventuality we will contact you.</li>
<li>Visual arts contributions should be as .jpeg files and may be sent as attachments. Image submissions should be original work or cite relevant permissions from copyright owners.</li>
<li>All contributors should include brief third person biographical details of up to five lines.</li>
<li>We will attempt to acknowledge receipt of all submissions within four weeks of arrival, but cannot promise to do so.</li>
<li>Payment for publication in <em>The Shit Creek Review</em> is not possible in this life, but contributors will be rewarded in the next. On the other hand the editors are very receptive to offers (redeemable in this life) of cash bribes, vouchers, favours, and so forth.</li>
