			<p>Turn the deadbolt. Turn it back. Again.<br />
The brass clack clack is the word for safe<br />
but nothing is safe. The bolt was never proof;<br />
you’ve always known exactly how the monsters could get in.<br />
Turn the hallway light off and on and off.</p>
<p>The part of you that thinks, and knows the names and causes,<br />
knows the door is locked, and wishes you would stop.<br />
Underneath that is where another you rises.<br />
It makes your hands priest through the ritual phrases.<br />
It takes all your reasons to come out on top.</p>
<p>Later, when you wake, because the lights are on the walls,<br />
you will wait until the shadows have returned to what they are.<br />
You need to breathe deep when the nails are on the sills,<br />
and remember what the darkness is until the darkness fails<br />
though the darkness will win. Faith is a star -</p>
<p>but even stars, they say, are bones, whose hearts,<br />
whose perfect burning hearts are long ago dead,<br />
and all we have of them is what the mirror reports,<br />
though we stare into their deaths until the pilgrim glass converts.<br />
The darkness waits patiently until the stars are bled.</p>
<p>You can hear the dead stars falling through the leaves.<br />
Get up and check the lock, and slide the bolt back,<br />
and rack the brass bolt back and forth through its grooves,<br />
take it through its tricks until the angel arrives.<br />
There is nothing safe and prayer is clack clack.</p>
