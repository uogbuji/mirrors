					<h1 style="margin-top:20px;">Bug on Board: M. A. Griffiths at Sonnet Central</h1> <h2 class="author_byline">by <a href = "../contributors/index.html#bio2207" title="About the author">Mike Alexander</a></h2><p class='spacer'>&nbsp;</p><p>M. A. Griffiths’ first appearance on <a href="http://thesonnetboard.yuku.com/" target="_blank">the Sonnet Board</a> was in July of 2002, under the pseudonym &#8220;grasshopper.&#8221; The poem, headed “Ding Dong Bell,” introduced her to us, as seen by her own cat, in whose eyes she was a woman bustling about her apartment, readying it “to impress her friends.” </p>
<div style="margin:0.3in;">
Great Bast, today she pulled out all the stops,<br />
all faff and fussle to impress her friends;<br />
the bedrooms were a whirl of cloths and mops,<br />
much bathroom bleach sploshed all around the bends,<br />
great waspiness of Hoover on the stairs.
</div>
<p>She was wearing a gypsy scarf &#038; a fetching dress; her furnishings were spit-spot, &#038; the kitchen smelled inviting. We entered, as her guests, “in a festive mood.” How could we not feel for her when her feline narrator chose that moment to ruin the carefully orchestrated scene, indecorously peeing on the Persian rug? </p>
<p>She quickly showed us how varied her voice could be. Two days later she posted a poem called “Haemorrhage” which ended:</p>
<div style="margin:0.3in;">
One day her mouth flooded with blood.<br />
It did not come from her teeth or her<br />
throat, but from the chambers of her heart.
</div>
<p>Her “Rime of the Ancient Mountaineer” appeared the next day, written in response to a challenge to write a poem about mountains. It incorporated several mountaineering-specific terms, the meanings of which, she explained, “don&#8217;t really matter for the poem.” She was quick to reveal her own “misuse” of the word “crampon,” though whether it was a misusage or a metaphor was open to interpretation. </p>
<div style="margin:0.3in;">
I raised my crampon &mdash; ah, my heart was rock &mdash;<br />
Alas, &#8217;twas I who shot the alpenstock.
</div>
<p>Admitting the obvious source of her poem’s title, she was not overawed by Coleridge. “I don’t think he was a master of archaic English,” she said.</p>
<p>Archaicism was one <em>bête noir</em>; inversion, another. Here is a taste of her counsel on the subject from February 2004.</p>
<div style="margin:0.3in 0.6in 0.3in 0.3in;">
For me, art is about communication. We don&#8217;t communicate with the past, but with the present, and hopefully the future as well. Personally, I don&#8217;t think the poems of the past are better because of conventions that twist the natural order of an English sentence out of kilter, but I accept that they were using the contemporary literary conventions.</p>
<p>In modern verse, I find it more satisfying when the voice is a voice which is contemporary to me &mdash; when there is no barrier of antique poesy-ness. Such devices alienate me, and I know they alienate other readers, and the fact that wonderful modern sonnets are written without them proves they are not necessary. Forms evolve. The voice of the sonnet is evolving &mdash; hurray! Things that are fossilised tend to end up in museums.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t deny some authors find [it] easier to write formal verse by using devices like inversions as standard. What is obvious about such an inversion is that it calls attention to a rhyming word, whether or not that word should be emphasized for the sake of the poem. The truth is that it&#8217;s for the good of the author &mdash; and that should be at the bottom of the list of literary priorities.
</p></div>
<p>Often, the people arguing the opposite pole would take her defense of contemporary diction for a moratorium, a shoot-on-sight order against anything not contemporarily prosaic. Nothing could be farther from the truth. She could enjoy a well-turned inversion, even in her own work, so long as it was not a refuge for laziness. I hear much more in this than a mere diatribe against a particular device. I hear a need for a connection between the Art &#038; the Human, a passion for the craft, &#038; a low tolerance for preciosity. Even in the midst of an argument, she was careful to be clear &#038; deliberate.</p>
<p>Sadly, the unchecked contrariness common to on-line communities, then as now, probably poisoned the well for Maz. As 2004 ran on, we saw less &#038; less of Maz. She had other workshops, &#038; life intruded, as it does. It was on the Sonnet Board that I heard she was gone.</p>
