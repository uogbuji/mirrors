					<h1 style="margin-top:20px;">Contributors</h1><div id="bios"><p><a name="bio3303"></a><b>The Five Editors of the Apocalypse</b>: 
<br><br>
<b>Angela France</b> writes poems, reads poems, studies poems, edits poetry journals and runs a poetry reading series but the day job sometimes gets in the way. Her second collection, <i>Occupation</i> is available from Ragged Raven Press and a pamphlet, <i>Lessons in Mallemaroking</i> came out from Nine Arches Press in Summer 2011.
<br><br>
<b>Ann Drysdale</b> writes a bit. Much of it poetry. She has five books of that, which she carries around with her and offers for sale on street corners until moved on by the police.  She picks up unconsidered trifles everywhere she goes and talks to herself constantly, holding a small bar of chocolate to one ear so that people will think she owns a mobile phone.
<br><br>
<b>Pat Jones</b>is an artist, poet, and retired disability advocate.
<br><br>
<b>Paul Stevens</b> has been taken away by The Rapture and is rapping on with ye Heavenly Houris.
<br><br>

Gunga Din was a better man than him, but that’s not saying much. What’s in a name? The hagard <b>Ryder De’Ath</b> insists that all days end and the innocence we are said to have lost we neither won nor lost but chose through constitutional majority. Jonas Bals said that in Norwegian anyway, but what <i>is</i> in a name?

Much of it poetry. She has five books of that, which she carries around with her and offers for sale on street corners until moved on by the police.  She picks up unconsidered trifles everywhere she goes and talks to herself constantly, holding a small bar of chocolate to one ear so that people will think she owns a mobile phone.</p><p><a name="artbio3177"></a><b>Marcel Duchamp</b> made some trouble a hundred years ago, and he was damn good at chess.</p><p><a name="bio3206"></a><b>Kathy Earsman</b> lives in Maleny, Queensland.
