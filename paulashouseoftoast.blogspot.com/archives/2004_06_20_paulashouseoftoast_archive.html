			<div class="blogPost">
			     <br /><img src="../lotus.jpg" /><br /><br />It was clear within a few measures that the piece's title referred not only to the instrument for which it was written, but to the dynamic in which it was to be played: soft. And also, by extension, to the substance -- the topic, the agenda, the motive --  of the music, a long piano piece by the contemporary American composer Morton Feldman. The piece was about softness. A specific type of softness: audible softness. Which is a matter solely of dynamic, not of precision. Of quietness, not yielding, blurry texture.<br /><br />So immediately the subtext of the piece (a subtext common to all pieces, of course) became evident: listen. It was a bodily imperative. It pulled me, the listener, bodily, toward, into, the music. The better, as the tale goes, to hear it with, my dears. It called my ears themselves into question. Those fleshy sound cones and their little whinging diaphragms, their jiggling ossicular chain, the chambered nautilus of the cochlea, the ionic fluxing nerve strings, the big dark brain and all its dark little drawers. It ordered the body: sit still, lest your creaks and rustlings overwhelm the music.<br /><br />It was a new piece to me. And, as difficult contemporary music, lacked the predictable gestures and pathways of baroque or classical pieces or popular songs. Listen to enough baroque music, and you can predict where it will be a few measures hence. Anticipatory hearing. Listen to a familiar piece, and the brain hums along, anticipating its every move, trumping it, racing it to the resolution. It's comfortable and comforting, like an old friend's face that one doesn't <em>really</em> see anymore. But the Feldman piece was a difficult stranger, and, unschooled in any musical vocabulary that would help me talk to myself about it -- this is a sonata, this is a fugue -- I was at sea.<br /><br />Which was a good place to be. The piece was setting the body up to listen as carefully as possible. Demanding it. So I took some breaths and let go of thoughts much as one does while doing sitting meditation and directed my attention to the sound. Of course, the listener was there, too, most of the time, like the thinker in sitting practice. But it was keeping a low profile -- more nagging, than, say, the thought "these seats are really hard," but low enough. <br /><br />Along with being soft, the piece was slow, with lots of sostenuto. Chordal rather than contrapuntal. So slow that the very onset of the sound of each chord broke open and revealed itself as a complex event -- hammer on and off string, vibration. Which led backward to key, finger, arm, brain-eye-ear: the pianist. The signs on the page before her. Thence to the composer, and his ear and mind and hand and musical experience.<br /><br />So chord followed chord, slowly, softly, complex, shifting, dissonant. Into the body. Within the body. For brief moments there was simply the music. Sound and time. The sound now. The sound just past -- echoing, resonant, in memory. And pure receptivity and emptiness.<br /><br />Then suddenly, deep into the piece, a crashing chord: forte. A hundred bodies startled. A hundred adrenal glands squirted out little jets of adrenalin. A hundred hearts went from andante to allegro.  The chord decayed -- loud faded to soft -- and, even within it, the stately succession of slow, soft chords continued. <br /><br />It was an amazing moment in an amazing piece.<br /><br />It was a piece about listening. About attention. About the nature of sound, and the nature of hearing. In the same way that abstract expressionist art is about the nature of color, line, and their interactions. One can write about it, sure, but mainly it's between the sound and the ear, the canvas and the eye.<br /><br />And it struck me, later, that this was a quasi eucharistic experience, a communion. The audience was one body, one ear, united in the aural body of the music. The pianist -- the marvelous Ursula Oppens -- was the priest who caused the transubstantiation of sign into living sound.<br /><br />   <br /><br />    <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />

		 <h2>Ordnance Music<a name="108816842028031992">&nbsp;</a></h2>
			<div class="blogPost">
			     <br /><img src="../danse.jpg" /><br /><br />It was a perfect early summer evening in Boston, in that vanishingly small window between cold, damp spring, and oppressively hot midsummer. The concert was at Jordan Hall at the Conservatory; as we walked toward the hall, my husband, an alumnus, marveled aloud at how his memories of his days there over twenty years ago were less than vivid. <br /><br />As we settled into our seats, I thought more about memory. <br /><br />My first time in Jordan Hall had been in 1971 or 1972. I attended a concert by the Dutch recorder virtuoso Frans Brueggen, and wrote about it in my journal with the ecstatic enthusiasm of the unworldly undergradute that I was then. I suspect that the writing was the reason that I remember it so well. My husband and I tried to recall the times we'd attended concerts at Jordan Hall together, and could, between us, exhume a mere fragment: some program that included Stravinsky's L'Histoire du Soldat, with narration by the late, locally famous public radio classical musical host, Robert J. Lertsema. <br /><br />But I could, oddly enough, remember quite clearly where I'd sat those two times -- on the left side of the hall in the 70's, and on the right balcony for L'Histoire. How will I remember last night's concert ? Will I remember the thin, quiet man who sidled up to me in the Dunkin' Donuts as I waited for my husband to get coffee, and whispered <em> do you have any spare change ? </em>  Will I remember our conversation about memory ? How does the likelihood that experience will fade from memory effect its value ?  What fragments am I shoring up against what ruin ? <br /><br />Jordan Hall is small, old and beautiful. Filling the back wall of the small stage are ranks of organ pipes; gilt cherubim cavort above them. The stage pillars are ornately carved, and the ceiling rises to a tall, windowed dome. <br /><br />As I considered the organ, I found myself doing some mental calculation. <br /><br />Does its existence counterbalance, or nullify in any way the existence of guns and bombs ? Windchest for warchest ?  And, if so, is there a strictly numerical relationship -- one pipe organ equals 1000 small arms or a cache of machine guns or an SUV packed with explosives ? One clarinet equals a grenade; one oil painting a surface to air missile; one poem a magazine full of bullets.  <br /><br />Or maybe it doesn't work that way at all. Maybe the ordnance nullifies the organ, vox humana and vox angelica, rendering it as culturally irrelevant and outmoded as the pudgy-kneed cherubim. I gazed at the two side-by-side pianos -- black steinway grands -- on the stage. They reminded me of coffins. I imagined them exploding, performer and all. Limbs, keys, wire sprayed everywhere, ceiling to floor. Such a thing could happen.  <br /><br />I thought back to Brueggen in the 70's. During one of his pieces, likely some baroque sonata, an actor was stationed in an easy chair beside a floor lamp, and read the newspaper through the whole piece. As if to say: ho hum. Wallpaper music. Easy listening. Backgound music. I seemed to remember that the Boston Globe had even noted this little gesture of self-critique on its editorial page. Had Vietnam been the context of his small protest ?<br /><br />The Jordan Hall cherubs, I reflected, were not without irony. Not simply decorative kitsch, but serious irony. A reminder similar to Brueggen's man-in-the-armchair.  <br /><br />This was a concert of the  Conservatory's annual summer piano institute, which I assume includes among its students the most avant garde and promising of young musicians. And the pianist was Ursula Oppens, well known for her performance of new music. Modern music, post-modern music.  Music that takes the dislocations and brutalities of the zeitgeist into account. Music that is post-tonal, post-Auschwitz, post-Hiroshima, post-AIDS, post-Church, acknowledges randomness, the death of God, and the ongoing ascendency of greed, cruelty and force in the world. Broken-hearted music. Which does not mean joyless.<br /><br />Here's a poem I wrote six or seven years ago in an even more bitter frame of mind.<br /><br /><br />iii. Like Birdsong<br /><br />Can you recall what music was before<br />the instruments were reclassified <br />by raw material, flashpoint, melting point,<br /><br />before drumsticks, mallets, bows and violins<br />were kindling wood, before stripped bassoons <br />and clarinets, split for firewood, burned,<br /><br />before the necks of cellos and bass viols,<br />the unstrung harps and gutted baby grands<br />were stacked up for cordwood,  before the flayed <br /><br />drumheads and sheared-off strings were stitched <br />into rucksacks, hairshirts and mattresses, <br />before trumpets, cymbals, glockenspiels, trombones,<br /><br />spitvalves, thumbrests, leafsprings, and ligatures, <br />were all cast into the defiler’s fire,<br />fusing to a useful, dull alloy<br /><br />and every last sixty-four cents’ worth<br />of water vapor, ash and quicklime<br />dispersed like birdsong on the afterwind ?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />    <br />

			<div class="blogPost">
			     <br /><img src="../freud.JPG" /><br /><br /><br />I was walking along the river path today with my camera. It was around noon, and I saw a worker from a nearby plant unwrapping his lunch on one of the pathside split-log benches. I approached, smiling. He stared back, and said:<br /><br /><em> That's quite a lens. </em><br /><br />I acknowledged my macro lenses heft and utility. He continued to stare, seemingly dumbstruck, so I moved on. <br /><br />But it IS quite an impressive looking lens, and he was not the first passerby to comment on it. And so far, all the strangers who have commented on it have been guys. It's not that only guys strike up conversations -- I've had any number of brief, pleasant chats with women strollers, bikers and dog-walkers, and none of them have admired my big lens. <br /><br />Even in my Freudian days, I'd never really connected with the concept of penis-envy. It seemed far fetched. Silly, even. Who'd want one of those inconvenient-appearing, oddly hydraulic, stuck-on, after-thought-like dangly things ? I was, all in all, rather pleased not to be burdened with one. And not to be burdened with the attendant worries about comparative size and function that seem to plague some men. Not that we women are free from body-part size issues. Who's got the smallest waist, longest legs, biggest breasts: these are the measures our surreptitious glances take.<br /><br />But today, on the riverbank, with my camera, and without even trying, I'd become the alpha male.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />  <br /><br /><br />

		 <h2>Get Your Grimy Little Mitt Off MY Constitution<a name="108790294444320200">&nbsp;</a></h2>
			<div class="blogPost">
			     <br /><br /><img src="../300flowers.jpg" /><br /><br /><br />I'm no student of government, law and social policy. I'm about as far from a "wonk" as one can get, although I love the word and would like somehow to apply it to myself. (Wildflower wonk ?) But isn't one of the chief bits of rightist republican dogma the states rights thingy ? I mean weren't we reminded during the recent Orgiastic Reagan Obsequies of one of the Gipper's first political speeches, some deeply coded gem delivered in the deepest bowels of the south, that extolled "states rights" AKA the "right to racial segregation" ?<br /><br />Yet when it comes to marriage rights, the prospect of individual states deciding for themselves to move into a 21st century of tolerance and freedom, sends the same folks into a dither about the the "confusion" that will result.  And sends them scuttling to the federal Constitution, into which they propose to ram some rights-denying, homophobia-enshrining, church-and-state-separation defying nonsense. <br /><br />My fellow physician, the loathsome cat-murdering thoracic surgeon and gay basher Dr Frist, currently Senate majority leader, has decided that there's no time like the present for Constitution desecrating. And, of course, "it's not political."  <br /><br />So The Mitthead's going to Washington. To testify before the Judiciary committee. And, again, it's not "political,"  as his various highly remunerated, unsavory (homage due here to that master of complex political epithets, <a href="http://www.romneyisafraud.blogspot.com/">RiAF</a>) mouthpieces have been reminding us. The Mitthead has no aspirations whatsoever toward the White House. Uh huh. Right.  <br /><br />It's to prevent confusion.<br /><br />Is "prevent confusion" going to become the new right wing code word for legislating homophobic bigotry ?  <br /><br /><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/06/22/romney_to_speak_before_us_panel/">Viz</a>: "He will argue that, even if gay marriage is confined to Massachusetts residents, some of those married couples will eventually relocate and test the limits of their rights in other states, and the issue will no longer be confined to Massachusetts. He is expected to call for a federal constitutional amendment as the only way to avoid that confusion nationally."<br /><br />And, for that matter, doesn't the constitution <em>already</em> contain confusion-avoiding language that guarantees all (that's A-L-L) citizens equal protection under the law ? And some thingy about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness ? So wouldn't a clause prohibiting same sex marriage make the document internally self-contradictory ?  <br /><br />Myself, I think it's time for the Mitthead to do the only honorable thing. Follow his Connecticut colleague Governor Rowland's example and resign in disgrace. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />      <br />
